Today is a rainy day. I stayed at shanghai and need to work from office. I have a lot of work to do. I have many plans to do.

First, I need to finish the product design and development for Nexa Merchant, which is a new product for our project.

Second, I plan to have a meeting with my team to discuss the ERP project. We need to make a decision on the project plan.

Third, I need to prepare the presentation for the meeting with the client. I need to make sure that the presentation is clear and concise.

Today is a busy day, but I am excited to work on these projects. I hope that everything goes well and that we can make progress on our projects.

Like that I spent my day in Shanghai. And Talk about our new topic in the evening. I am happy to work with my team. I hope that we can achieve our goals and make our project successful.
