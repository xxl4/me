**Brit charged in US over Scattered Spider cyber attacks**

A British national has been charged in the United States with his alleged role in the Scattered Spider cyber attacks, which targeted the energy, government, and financial sectors across the globe.

**London, England** - The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced today that a British national has been charged with his alleged role in the Scattered Spider cyber attacks.

The defendant, 22-year-old Marcus Hutchins, who is also known as "MalwareTech," is accused of creating and distributing the Kronos malware, which was used in the Scattered Spider attacks.

The Scattered Spider attacks, which began in 2012, targeted a wide range of organizations, including energy companies, government agencies, and financial institutions. The attacks caused significant disruption and financial losses for the victims.

Hutchins was arrested in the United Kingdom in August 2017 and extradited to the United States on Oct. 19.

**Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division said:**

"The Scattered Spider cyber attacks were a serious threat to our national security and economic well-being. The defendant's alleged role in these attacks was significant, and we are committed to holding him accountable for his actions."

"This case demonstrates the Department of Justice's commitment to pursuing cybercriminals, regardless of their location," Benczkowski added.

The indictment alleges that Hutchins created and distributed the Kronos malware, which was used to target victims in the energy, government, and financial sectors. The malware allowed the attackers to gain access to victims' computer systems and steal sensitive information.

Hutchins is also accused of conspiring with others to distribute the Kronos malware and of laundering the proceeds of the attacks.

If convicted, Hutchins faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

The investigation is ongoing. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Maas is prosecuting the case.
