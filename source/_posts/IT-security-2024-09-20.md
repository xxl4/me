## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE) is an automotive security and convenience feature that allows a driver to unlock and start a vehicle without needing to use a traditional key. Instead, a PKE system uses a small, encrypted fob that emits a radio frequency (RF) signal. This signal is detected by an antenna in the vehicle, which then unlocks the doors and allows the driver to start the engine by pressing a button on the dashboard.

PKE systems are designed to be more convenient than traditional keys, as they allow drivers to keep their keys in their pockets or bags while approaching and entering their vehicles. They are also more secure than traditional keys, as they are difficult to duplicate and can be programmed to only work with specific vehicles.

PKE systems are becoming increasingly common on new vehicles, and they are expected to become even more popular in the future. As PKE systems become more sophisticated, they are likely to offer additional features, such as the ability to unlock and start a vehicle from a distance or to allow multiple drivers to share a single key fob.
