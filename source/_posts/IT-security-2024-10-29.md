## What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/two-factor-authentication)

Published: Mon, 28 Oct 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires users to provide two pieces of evidence to access a particular resource or account. This is typically used to enhance security beyond a simple password.

The two factors usually comprise:

1. **Something you know**, such as a password or PIN.
2. **Something you have**, such as a physical token (e.g., a smart card or mobile phone) or a biometric characteristic (e.g., a fingerprint or facial scan).

When using 2FA, a user is prompted to provide both factors when logging in. This makes it much more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access to an account, even if they have obtained the user's password.

Here's an example of how 2FA works:

1. A user attempts to log in to their online banking account.
2. They are prompted to enter their username and password.
3. After entering their password, they are prompted to enter a one-time password (OTP) that has been sent to their mobile phone.
4. The user enters the OTP and is granted access to their account.

By using 2FA, the bank can be confident that the person logging in is who they say they are, even if someone else has obtained their password.

2FA is a highly effective way to improve the security of online accounts. It is recommended that users enable 2FA for all of their important accounts, such as email, banking, and social media.

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/tailgating-piggybacking)

Published: Thu, 17 Oct 2024 18:01:00 GMT

**Tailgating (Piggybacking)**

Tailgating is a physical security breach method where an unauthorized person gains entry to a restricted area by following closely behind an authorized person through an access point. The term "piggybacking" is sometimes used interchangeably with tailgating but specifically refers to gaining access by riding on the coattails of an authorized person without their knowledge.

**How it Works:**

1. The unauthorized person waits outside an access point, such as a door or gate, and observes the area.
2. When an authorized person approaches the access point, the unauthorized person positions themselves close behind them.
3. As the authorized person enters, the unauthorized person follows immediately after, before the access point can be resecured (e.g., door closing, gate lowering).
4. The unauthorized person now has access to the restricted area without having proper authorization or credentials.

**Risks and Consequences:**

* **Security breaches:** Tailgating can compromise sensitive areas and information.
* **Theft and sabotage:** Unauthorized individuals could steal assets or engage in malicious activities.
* **Loss of trust:** Tailgating undermines the integrity of security measures and can erode trust in the organization.

**Prevention Measures:**

* **Two-factor authentication:** Require a second form of identification (e.g., ID card, PIN) upon entry.
* **Mante traps:** Install revolving doors or other physical barriers that prevent multiple people from entering at once.
* **Proximity detection:** Use sensors to detect unauthorized persons following closely behind authorized individuals.
* **Security guards:** Place security personnel at access points to monitor for and prevent tailgating.
* **Tailgating awareness training:** Educate employees about the risks of tailgating and how to prevent it.

**Robust Cloud IAM Aligned with Zero-Trust Principles**

Implementing a robust Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) system that adheres to zero-trust principles is crucial for ensuring secure and compliant access to cloud resources. Here's how these principles should guide your IAM strategy:

**1. Least Privilege:**

* Grant users only the minimum permissions required to perform their tasks.
* Use fine-grained access control to assign permissions based on roles and resource hierarchy.

**2. Identity Verification:**

* Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and risk-based authentication.
* Use identity federation to centralize authentication and reduce the risk of compromised credentials.

**3. Continuous Monitoring:**

* Log and monitor all access events to detect suspicious activities and identify potential breaches.
* Use anomaly detection and threat intelligence to identify unusual behavior and respond quickly.

**4. Network Isolation:**

* Create separate virtual private networks (VPNs) for different user groups and applications.
* Implement micro-segmentation to isolate resources and prevent lateral movement in case of a breach.

**5. Least Exposure Surface:**

* Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to limit external access to cloud resources.
* Disable unnecessary ports and services to reduce attack vectors.

**6. Data Protection:**

* Encrypt data at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
* Use tokenization and data masking to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

**7. Limited Delegation:**

* Carefully review and manage service account permissions to avoid overprivileged access.
* Use Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning to grant permissions temporarily only when needed.

**8. Regular Review and Validation:**

* Conduct regular audits to assess the effectiveness of IAM controls.
* Review user permissions and roles periodically to ensure compliance and identify potential risks.

By adhering to these zero-trust principles, organizations can establish a robust IAM system that minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. This approach enables organizations to secure their cloud deployments while maintaining flexibility and agility.
