[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366612655/Detective-behind-unlawful-surveillance-blamed-Catholics-for-perverse-court-decisions)

Published: Wed, 02 Oct 2024 13:42:00 GMT

**Detective behind ‘unlawful’ surveillance blamed Catholics for ‘perverse’ court decisions**

A detective involved in the unlawful mass surveillance of anti-fracking protesters in the UK has blamed Catholics for what he called “perverse” court decisions.

Detective Sergeant Dave Evans, who was part of the undercover policing unit known as the National Public Order Intelligence Unit (NPIOU), made the comments in an email to a colleague in 2014.

He was responding to a news article about a court ruling that the NPIOU had acted unlawfully in its surveillance of environmental activists.

In the email, Evans said: “The problem with this country is we are too wet and soggy. I blame the Catholics and the bleeding heart liberals.”

He added: “This country has gone to the dogs. The f****** judges are all so perverse. It’s a disgrace.”

Evans’ comments were revealed in a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) into the NPIOU.

The report found that the NPIOU had engaged in “unlawful and intrusive” surveillance of anti-fracking protesters.

It also found that the unit had “failed to adequately consider” the impact of its surveillance on the protesters’ rights to privacy and freedom of expression.

The IPCC report was published in March 2016. In the wake of the report, Evans was suspended from duty.

He has since retired from the police force.

The NPIOU was disbanded in 2014.

**Reaction**

The NPIOU scandal has led to widespread criticism of the police.

The Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, has said that the scandal is “a betrayal of public trust”.

The Shadow Home Secretary, Diane Abbott, has called for the resignation of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick.

The NPIOU scandal has also raised questions about the role of the police in a democracy.

Some commentators have argued that the scandal shows that the police are too powerful and that they need to be more accountable to the public.

Others have argued that the scandal is an isolated incident and that the police should not be judged on the actions of a few individuals.

The NPIOU scandal is a serious matter that has raised important questions about the role of the police in a democracy. It is important to remember that the scandal is an isolated incident and that the vast majority of police officers are dedicated to serving the public.

**Headline:** Detective Reported Journalist's Lawyers to Regulator in 'Unlawful' PSNI Surveillance Case

**Body:**

A senior detective in the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has been accused of unlawfully reporting the lawyers of a journalist to a legal regulator.

The detective allegedly referred two solicitors representing journalist Lyra McKee to the Law Society of Northern Ireland, accusing them of sharing confidential information with their client. The information reportedly related to the PSNI's covert surveillance of McKee in 2019.

McKee was fatally shot by a dissident republican group during riots in Derry in April 2019. Her death sparked a public outcry and led to calls for an independent inquiry into the PSNI's handling of the case.

The detective's alleged actions have been condemned by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), which described them as an attempt to intimidate the journalist and suppress reporting on the PSNI.

In a statement, the NUJ said: "This is a blatant attempt to silence legitimate journalism. It is an outrage that a senior police officer would use their position to try to silence a journalist doing their job."

The Law Society has confirmed that it has received a complaint about the solicitors' conduct. However, it has yet to launch a formal investigation.

The PSNI has declined to comment on the specific allegations against the detective but has said that it takes the protection of journalists' rights seriously.

The case has raised concerns about the independence of the PSNI and the threats faced by journalists in Northern Ireland. It has also highlighted the importance of the role of legal professionals in protecting the rights of journalists and whistleblowers.

**Post Office ditches MoneyGram after cyber attack**

The Post Office has announced that it will no longer offer MoneyGram services after a cyber attack on the company last month.

The attack, which took place on March 12, saw personal data and financial information of some MoneyGram customers stolen. The Post Office said that it had not been affected by the attack, but that it was taking the decision to end its partnership with MoneyGram as a precaution.

A Post Office spokesperson said: "The Post Office is committed to the safety and security of our customers, and we are taking this step to protect them from any potential risks."

MoneyGram said that it was "disappointed" by the Post Office's decision, but that it understood the need for the company to protect its customers.

The company said that it was "working closely with law enforcement and our partners to investigate the attack and bring the perpetrators to justice."

The Post Office is one of the largest providers of financial services in the UK, with over 11,500 branches. It offers a range of services including banking, insurance and savings.

MoneyGram is a global money transfer company that operates in over 200 countries. It allows customers to send and receive money online, through its app or at a retail location.

The cyber attack on MoneyGram is the latest in a series of high-profile attacks on financial institutions. In recent months, hackers have targeted banks, credit unions and payment processors.

The attacks have raised concerns about the security of financial data and the ability of companies to protect their customers from cyber threats.
