description: A sunny Monday in Shanghai.
---

Today is Monday, a sunny day. I woke up at 6:30 am, and I started to brush tooth and wash face. I went to the office at 8:30 am. I had a meeting with my team at 9:30 am. 

Yesterday, I go to the gym and did some exercises. I feel good today. but i have a lot of work to do. I need to finish the work before 8:00 pm. all most 12 hours work today.

Today ,i want to discuss with my team about the new project. I hope we can finish the project in time. I also need to prepare the presentation for the project. I hope everything goes well.

Every project has its own challenges. I need to face the challenges and solve the problems. I believe I can do it. I have confidence in myself.

We will use the new technology to finish the project. But we only know a little about the new technology. We need to learn more about it. I hope we can learn it quickly. and finish the project in time.
