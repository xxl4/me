**US TikTok Ban Imminent After Appeal Fails**

**Washington, D.C.** - A US federal appeals court has upheld a Trump administration order to ban TikTok, dealing a major blow to the popular social media app's operations in the United States. The court's ruling comes after the administration argued that the app posed a national security risk due to its ties to the Chinese government.

TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has vehemently denied these allegations, and legal experts believe that the ban could face further legal challenges. However, the court's decision means that TikTok is facing an imminent threat of being shut down in the US unless it can successfully appeal the ruling.

The ban, which is set to take effect on September 12th, would prohibit US citizens from downloading or updating the TikTok app, as well as from engaging in transactions with the company. It would also bar the app from being hosted on US-based servers.

"We are extremely disappointed by the ruling," said ByteDance in a statement. "We disagree with the court's decision and will continue to explore all options to ensure that TikTok remains available for our US users."

The administration has argued that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and could potentially share user data with the Chinese government. The company has denied these accusations, stating that it operates TikTok independently and that user data is stored in the United States.

The ban has sparked concern among TikTok users and creators, who fear losing their accounts and the ability to connect with their audiences. It has also raised questions about the future of other Chinese-owned apps in the United States.

The court's decision is likely to have significant implications for the US-China relationship and could further escalate tensions between the two countries. It also raises the question of whether the Biden administration will continue to pursue the ban if it takes office in January 2021.

For now, the fate of TikTok in the United States remains uncertain. The company has 12 days to appeal the ruling, but it is unclear whether the legal process will be completed before the ban takes effect.

**Government Agencies Urged to Use Encrypted Messaging After Chinese Salt Typhoon Hack**

Government agencies around the world are being urged to adopt encrypted messaging systems after a recent cyberattack attributed to China. The attack, known as Salt Typhoon, compromised the email accounts of government officials in multiple countries, including the United States.

According to a report from the cybersecurity firm FireEye, the attack was carried out by a group of Chinese hackers known as APT41. The group used phishing emails to trick government officials into clicking on malicious links, which then installed malware that allowed the hackers to access their email accounts.

The Salt Typhoon attack is the latest in a series of cyberattacks targeting government agencies. In recent years, several high-profile attacks have been attributed to Chinese hackers, including the 2014 hack of the Office of Personnel Management and the 2015 hack of the Democratic National Committee.

The use of encrypted messaging can help protect government agencies from these types of attacks. Encrypted messaging systems use encryption to scramble messages, making them unreadable to anyone who does not have the encryption key. This makes it much more difficult for hackers to intercept and read messages.

Several government agencies already use encrypted messaging systems, including the National Security Agency and the Department of Defense. However, many other agencies have yet to adopt these systems.

The Salt Typhoon attack is a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity for government agencies. Agencies must take steps to protect their networks and data from cyberattacks, including adopting encrypted messaging systems.

Here are some tips for government agencies on how to improve their cybersecurity:

* Use strong passwords and change them regularly.
* Be careful about clicking on links in emails, even if they appear to come from a trusted source.
* Install antivirus and anti-malware software on all devices.
* Regularly update your software and operating systems.
* Use a firewall to protect your network from unauthorized access.
* Back up your data regularly in case of a cyberattack.
* Develop a cybersecurity incident response plan.

By following these tips, government agencies can help protect themselves from cyberattacks and keep their data safe.

## VMware ‘shock’ spawned lock-in rebellion, says NetApp
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366616595/VMware-shock-has-led-to-lock-in-rebellion-says-NetApp)

Published: Tue, 03 Dec 2024 05:19:00 GMT

## VMware ‘shock’ spawned lock-in rebellion, says NetApp

**NetApp has claimed that VMware's shock move to "redefine its architectural and licensing model" has led to a "lock-in rebellion" as customers seek alternatives.**

In a blog post, NetApp's VP for strategic alliances and partnerships Atish Gude said that VMware's decision to charge for its vSphere virtualisation platform on a per-CPU basis had "sent shockwaves" through the industry.

"Customers are waking up to the fact that they are now locked into a situation where they are paying more for the same level of functionality," said Gude.

"This has led to a lock-in rebellion, with customers looking for alternatives that provide them with more flexibility and choice."

Gude claimed that NetApp's FlexPod converged infrastructure solution, which combines NetApp's storage with Cisco's networking and VMware's virtualisation, was "ideally positioned to meet the needs of customers who are looking for an alternative to VMware."

"FlexPod provides customers with the flexibility to choose the components that best meet their needs, and it eliminates the risk of vendor lock-in," said Gude.

VMware has defended its new licensing model, arguing that it is more transparent and predictable than its previous model. However, some customers have argued that the new model will lead to higher costs.

The lock-in rebellion is a sign that customers are becoming increasingly aware of the risks of vendor lock-in. In the past, customers were often reluctant to switch vendors because of the cost and complexity of migrating their applications and data. However, the rise of cloud computing and software-defined infrastructure is making it easier for customers to switch vendors.

As a result, vendors are under increasing pressure to provide customers with more flexibility and choice. Those that fail to do so may find themselves losing market share to more agile competitors.

**Second Merseyside hospital hit by cyber attack**

A second hospital in Merseyside has been hit by a cyber attack, forcing it to cancel some appointments and operations.

Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust said it had been targeted by a "sophisticated" attack on its IT systems.

The trust said it had taken the "difficult decision" to cancel some appointments and operations as a precaution.

It said it was working with the National Cyber Security Centre to resolve the issue.

A spokesperson for the trust said: "We are doing everything we can to restore our systems as quickly as possible and we apologise for any inconvenience this may cause."

It is the second hospital in Merseyside to be hit by a cyber attack in recent months.

In May, Aintree University Hospital was forced to cancel all non-urgent operations and appointments after it was hit by a ransomware attack.

The attack on Aintree was part of a wider ransomware attack that targeted a number of NHS organisations across the UK.

The National Cyber Security Centre said it is aware of the incident at Southport and Ormskirk Hospital and is working with the trust to resolve the issue.

A spokesperson for the NCSC said: "We are aware of an incident affecting Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust and we are working with the trust to understand the impact and provide support."

## What is obfuscation and how does it work?

Published: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:27:00 GMT

**Obfuscation** is the act of making code difficult to understand or reverse engineer. It is often used to protect intellectual property or to prevent malicious actors from exploiting vulnerabilities in software.

There are many different techniques that can be used to obfuscate code, including:

* **Name mangling:** This involves changing the names of variables, functions, and classes to make them more difficult to read.
* **Control flow flattening:** This involves removing all unnecessary branching and looping from code, making it more difficult to follow the flow of execution.
* **Data encryption:** This involves encrypting all of the data in a program, making it difficult to understand or modify.
* **Anti-debugging techniques:** These techniques make it more difficult for debuggers to attach to or run a program.

Obfuscation can be a very effective way to protect software from unauthorized access or modification. However, it can also make it more difficult to maintain and update the software. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons of obfuscation before using it.

**How does obfuscation work?**

Obfuscation works by making it more difficult for humans and computers to understand and reverse engineer code. By using a variety of techniques, obfuscators can make it difficult to trace the flow of execution, identify variables and functions, and access encrypted data.

Obfuscators typically use a combination of static and dynamic techniques. Static techniques are applied to the code before it is compiled or interpreted, while dynamic techniques are applied at runtime.

**Static obfuscation techniques**

* **Name mangling:** Obfuscators can change the names of variables, functions, and classes to make them more difficult to read. For example, an obfuscator might change the name of the variable "name" to something like "_n_a_m_e".
* **Control flow flattening:** Obfuscators can remove all unnecessary branching and looping from code, making it more difficult to follow the flow of execution. For example, an obfuscator might replace a loop with a series of if-else statements.
* **Data encryption:** Obfuscators can encrypt all of the data in a program, making it difficult to understand or modify. For example, an obfuscator might encrypt the contents of a file using a strong encryption algorithm.

**Dynamic obfuscation techniques**

* **Anti-debugging techniques:** Obfuscators can make it more difficult for debuggers to attach to or run a program. For example, an obfuscator might use exception handling to prevent a debugger from attaching to a program.
* **Runtime code generation:** Obfuscators can generate code at runtime, making it more difficult to analyze or reverse engineer. For example, an obfuscator might generate a random function name and then call that function using a reflection technique.

**Benefits of obfuscation**

* **Protects intellectual property:** Obfuscation can help to protect intellectual property by making it more difficult for competitors to steal or copy code.
* **Prevents malicious actors:** Obfuscation can help to prevent malicious actors from exploiting vulnerabilities in software.

**Drawbacks of obfuscation**

* **Makes code more difficult to maintain and update:** Obfuscation can make it more difficult to maintain and update code, as it can be difficult to understand and reverse engineer.
* **Can break functionality:** Obfuscation can sometimes break the functionality of a program, as it can alter the way that code executes.

**Conclusion**

Obfuscation is a technique that can be used to protect software from unauthorized access or modification. However, it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons of obfuscation before using it, as it can also make it more difficult to maintain and update the software.
