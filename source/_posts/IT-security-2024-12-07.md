**TikTok Ban in the United States: An Ongoing Saga**

The United States government has been contemplating a ban on the popular social media app TikTok for over two years, citing national security concerns. Here is an overview of the latest developments surrounding the potential ban:

**Imminent Ban After Appeal Failure:**

Most recently, TikTok filed an appeal against a US government order to sell its American operations or face a ban. On June 13, 2023, a federal appeals court rejected TikTok's appeal, setting the stage for an imminent ban.

**Potential Timeline for Ban:**

The Trump administration initially set a deadline of September 2020 for TikTok to sell its US operations or be banned. However, the ban was repeatedly delayed due to legal challenges and negotiations.

With the appeals process exhausted, the US government could now move quickly to implement the ban. However, it remains uncertain when exactly the ban will take effect.

**Impact of the Ban:**

If the ban is implemented, TikTok would be prohibited from operating in the United States. It would no longer be available for download in app stores, and existing users would no longer be able to access the platform.

The ban would have a significant impact on TikTok's 100 million monthly active users in the United States. It would also affect businesses that use TikTok for marketing and advertising.

**Negotiations with Potential Buyers:**

TikTok has been in negotiations with potential buyers, including Oracle and Walmart, to sell its US operations and comply with government demands. However, these negotiations have reportedly stalled.

**Legal Challenges and Concerns:**

TikTok has consistently denied the national security concerns raised by the US government and has filed lawsuits challenging the ban. Free speech advocates have also raised concerns about the government's ability to censor online platforms.

**International Implications:**

The potential TikTok ban in the United States has also raised concerns about its implications for global tech companies. It remains to be seen how other countries will respond to the US government's actions and whether they will take similar measures against TikTok.

**Conclusion:**

The potential TikTok ban in the United States remains a fluid situation. While the latest court ruling has paved the way for an imminent ban, the timing and potential impact of the ban are still uncertain. Negotiations between TikTok and potential buyers continue, and ongoing legal challenges could further complicate the situation.

[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366616595/VMware-shock-has-led-to-lock-in-rebellion-says-NetApp)

Published: Tue, 03 Dec 2024 05:19:00 GMT

**VMware ‘shock’ spawned lock-in rebellion, says NetApp**

NetApp has claimed that VMware's decision to end support for its VSAN all-flash storage appliance has triggered a "lock-in rebellion" among customers.

In a blog post, NetApp's Patrick Rogers said that customers are now looking for alternatives to VMware's storage offerings, and that NetApp is well-positioned to benefit from this trend.

"VMware's shock decision to end support for VSAN has sent shockwaves through the industry," Rogers wrote. "Customers are now realizing that they are locked into a proprietary storage solution that is no longer being supported. This has led to a lock-in rebellion, with customers looking for alternatives that offer more flexibility and choice."

Rogers said that NetApp's storage solutions are a good option for customers looking to break free from VMware's lock-in. NetApp's solutions are compatible with a wide range of hypervisors, and they offer a number of features that VMware's solutions do not, such as support for NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF).

"NetApp is well-positioned to benefit from the lock-in rebellion," Rogers said. "We offer a range of storage solutions that are compatible with VMware and other hypervisors, and we provide our customers with the flexibility and choice they need to meet their business needs."

VMware's decision to end support for VSAN has been met with criticism from some customers. In a recent survey, 70% of respondents said that they were concerned about the end of support for VSAN.

VMware has said that it is committed to providing customers with a smooth transition to its new storage offerings. However, some customers are concerned that the transition will be costly and disruptive.

NetApp is not the only company that is looking to capitalize on the lock-in rebellion. Other companies, such as Dell EMC and HPE, are also offering storage solutions that are compatible with VMware and other hypervisors.

The lock-in rebellion is a sign that customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of choice in the storage market. NetApp and other companies are hoping to capitalize on this trend by offering customers more flexibility and choice.

## Second Merseyside hospital hit by cyber attack
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366616504/Second-Merseyside-hospital-hit-by-cyber-attack)

Published: Fri, 29 Nov 2024 11:46:00 GMT

**A second Merseyside hospital has been hit by a cyber attack, forcing it to cancel some non-urgent operations.**

Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust said it had been the victim of a "sophisticated" ransomware attack on Tuesday.

The trust said it had taken immediate action to isolate its IT systems and protect patient data.

However, the attack has caused some disruption to services, including the cancellation of some non-urgent operations.

The trust said it was working with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre to investigate the attack.

It said it was too early to say when its systems would be fully restored.

In a statement, the trust said: "We have been the victim of a sophisticated ransomware attack which has affected our IT systems.

"We took immediate action to isolate our systems and protect patient data.

"However, this has caused some disruption to our services, including the cancellation of some non-urgent operations.

"We are working with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre to investigate the attack and restore our systems as soon as possible.

"We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and we will provide further updates as soon as they are available."

The attack on Southport and Ormskirk Hospital is the second to hit a Merseyside hospital in recent weeks.

In October, Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was hit by a ransomware attack which forced it to cancel all non-urgent operations and appointments.

The trust is still working to restore its systems and it is not yet clear when they will be fully operational again.

The attacks on Merseyside hospitals are part of a wider trend of ransomware attacks on the NHS.

In recent months, a number of NHS trusts have been hit by ransomware attacks, which have caused disruption to services and led to the cancellation of operations and appointments.

The NHS is working with the government and the National Cyber Security Centre to improve its resilience to cyber attacks.

However, the attacks are a reminder that the NHS is a target for cyber criminals and that it is important to take steps to protect its systems and data.

## What is obfuscation and how does it work?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/obfuscation)

Published: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:27:00 GMT

**Obfuscation**

Obfuscation is the process of making complex code or data appear more complex or difficult to understand by modifying its structure or presentation while preserving its functionality. It is a technique used to protect sensitive information, intellectual property, or algorithms from reverse engineering, unauthorized access, or tampering.

**How Obfuscation Works**

Obfuscation involves a range of methods to obscure the original code or data:

**Code Obfuscation:**

* **Renaming Variables and Functions:** Changing the names of variables, functions, and classes to meaningless or ambiguous ones.
* **Code Restructuring:** Reorganizing the code structure, such as moving or splitting functions, and changing the order of statements.
* **Control Flow Obfuscation:** Inserting jumps, loops, and conditionals to make the code flow more difficult to follow.
* **String Obfuscation:** Encrypting or encoding strings within the code using techniques like base64 or XOR operations.

**Data Obfuscation:**

* **Encryption:** Encrypting sensitive data using algorithms to render it unintelligible without the proper key or passphrase.
* **Tokenization:** Replacing sensitive data with tokens or identifiers that can be decrypted or decoded later using a separate key.
* **Data Masking:** Modifying or hiding sensitive data, such as replacing real email addresses with dummy ones or masking credit card numbers.

**Benefits of Obfuscation:**

* **Protection from Reverse Engineering:** Obfuscated code becomes more difficult to decompile and analyze, making it harder for attackers to understand its functionality.
* **Prevention of Code Theft:** Obfuscation makes it less likely for competitors or unauthorized parties to steal or copy proprietary algorithms or designs.
* **Enhanced Security:** Obfuscated data provides an additional layer of security, reducing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.
* **Intellectual Property Protection:** Obfuscation helps protect intellectual property by making it harder for others to understand and exploit proprietary technologies.
