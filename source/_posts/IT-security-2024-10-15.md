**Detective Wrongly Claimed Journalist's Solicitor Attempted to Buy Gun, Surveillance Tribunal Hears**

A detective has been accused of falsely claiming that a journalist's solicitor tried to buy a gun, a surveillance tribunal has heard.

The allegation was made during a hearing involving a complaint by journalist Rob Evans against the Metropolitan Police.

Evans is challenging the force's decision to put him under covert surveillance for 10 months in 2019 over his reporting on the Grenfell Tower fire.

The tribunal heard that Detective Constable Mark Ellison sent an email to his superiors in which he claimed that Evans' solicitor, Tamlyn Isherwood, had tried to buy a gun.

However, Isherwood denied the claim, and no evidence was ever found to support it.

The tribunal also heard that Ellison had failed to disclose relevant information to the court when he applied for a warrant to put Evans under surveillance.

Evans' barrister, Matthew Ryder, said that Ellison's evidence was "unreliable" and that he had "acted in bad faith."

The Metropolitan Police has denied wrongdoing and said that the surveillance of Evans was "necessary and proportionate."

The tribunal is expected to hear evidence from other witnesses before reaching a decision.

**Background**

Evans is a freelance journalist who has written extensively about the Grenfell Tower fire.

In 2019, the Metropolitan Police put Evans under covert surveillance for 10 months.

Evans was not told that he was under surveillance until after it had ended.

He has since complained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which has found that the surveillance was "unlawful."

The Metropolitan Police has apologized for the surveillance, but it has not admitted wrongdoing.

**The Surveillance Tribunal**

The Surveillance Tribunal is an independent body that hears complaints about the use of surveillance by public bodies.

The tribunal can make findings of fact and law, and it can recommend that the relevant public body take action.

The tribunal is currently hearing Evans' complaint against the Metropolitan Police.

**Rise of the Cyber Clones: When Seeing Isn't Believing**

In the hyperconnected digital age, the boundaries between the real and the virtual continue to blur. The advent of deepfake technology has heightened concerns over our ability to discern truth from deception.

**What are Deepfakes?**

Deepfakes are synthetically generated images, videos, or audio that depict a person or event that never occurred. They are created using deep learning algorithms that analyze and imitate the speech, facial expressions, and body movements of an individual.

**Unprecedented Deception**

Deepfakes have the potential to unleash an unprecedented level of deception. They can be used to create realistic videos of politicians saying things they never said, or celebrities engaging in activities they did not. This has the power to erode trust in public institutions and undermine the credibility of evidence.

**Seeing is No Longer Believing**

Traditionally, we have relied on sight as a primary means of verifying information. However, deepfakes challenge this assumption. With the ability to create highly convincing fabrications, seeing something with our own eyes is no longer a guarantee of its authenticity.

**Impact on Trust**

The proliferation of deepfakes has a profound impact on trust in media, governments, and institutions. It creates an atmosphere of uncertainty and makes it difficult to discern what is true and what is false. This can lead to a breakdown in communication and hinder the formation of informed decisions.

**Ethical Implications**

The ethical implications of deepfakes are vast. They raise concerns about privacy, defamation, and the spread of misinformation. Deepfakes can be used to blackmail individuals, tarnish reputations, and influence public opinion.

**Combating Deepfakes**

Combating deepfakes requires a multi-faceted approach. Improved detection tools, awareness campaigns, and legal frameworks are all necessary to mitigate the risks posed by this technology.

**Technological Solutions**

Advancements in artificial intelligence can also help in detecting deepfakes. Researchers are developing algorithms that can analyze subtle cues in images and videos to identify synthetic content.

**Media Literacy**

Media literacy plays a crucial role in equipping individuals with the skills to critically evaluate information and distinguish between real and fake content. Educational programs and awareness campaigns can raise public understanding of deepfakes and their potential dangers.

**Legal Frameworks**

Legislation can provide a necessary deterrent against the malicious use of deepfakes. Laws that criminalize the creation and distribution of deepfakes for deceptive purposes can help to protect individuals and society from the negative consequences of this technology.

**Conclusion**

The rise of deepfakes challenges our traditional notions of truth and reality. While this technology has the potential for entertainment and creativity, it also poses significant risks to trust, credibility, and social cohesion. By embracing technological solutions, fostering media literacy, and developing robust legal frameworks, we can mitigate the negative impacts of deepfakes and preserve the integrity of our digital landscape.
