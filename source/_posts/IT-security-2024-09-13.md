**UN-backed Cyber Security Report Exposes Global Deficiencies in Preparedness**

A comprehensive cyber security report endorsed by the United Nations has revealed significant shortcomings in global preparedness, leaving countries and organizations vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.

**Key Findings**

* **Lack of Investment:** Many governments and businesses are failing to allocate adequate resources for cyber security measures, leading to understaffed teams and outdated technologies.
* **Skills Gap:** There is a severe shortage of skilled cyber security professionals worldwide, making it difficult for organizations to detect, respond to, and recover from cyberattacks.
* **Ineffective Coordination:** Cooperation between national and international agencies, as well as between the public and private sectors, is often fragmented, hindering effective response efforts.
* **Lack of Regulation:** Many countries lack comprehensive cyber security laws and regulations, creating a legal vacuum that cybercriminals can exploit.
* **Public Awareness:** General public awareness of cyber security risks and best practices is still relatively low, increasing the likelihood of individuals and organizations falling victim to attacks.

**Impact of Deficiencies**

The report emphasizes that these deficiencies have severe consequences:

* **Increased Cybercrime:** Cybercriminals are exploiting vulnerabilities to launch damaging attacks, resulting in financial losses, identity theft, and disruption of essential services.
* **Erosion of Trust:** Weak cyber security measures erode trust in digital technologies and online transactions, undermining economic growth and social development.
* **National Security Threats:** Cyberattacks can target critical infrastructure, such as power grids and financial systems, posing a significant threat to national security.
* **Humanitarian Crises:** Cyberattacks can disrupt disaster relief efforts and access to essential services, exacerbating humanitarian emergencies.

**Recommendations**

The report calls for urgent action from governments, businesses, and individuals to address these shortcomings. It urges them to:

* **Increase Investment:** Allocate sufficient resources for cyber security measures, including training, infrastructure, and personnel.
* **Bridge the Skills Gap:** Promote education and training programs to create a pool of skilled cyber security professionals.
* **Foster Collaboration:** Enhance coordination between agencies and sectors to facilitate information sharing and joint response efforts.
* **Develop Regulations:** Establish clear and comprehensive cyber security laws and regulations to protect citizens and organizations.
* **Raise Public Awareness:** Educate the public about cyber security risks and best practices to reduce vulnerability to attacks.

**Conclusion**

The UN-backed cyber security report highlights the urgent need for global action to improve preparedness and mitigate the growing threat of cyberattacks. By addressing these deficiencies, countries and organizations can strengthen their defenses and ensure a safer and more secure digital world.

## European enterprise networking lacks hybrid maturity
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366610425/European-enterprise-networking-lacks-hybrid-maturity)

Published: Thu, 12 Sep 2024 07:28:00 GMT

**European Enterprise Networking Lacks Hybrid Maturity**

A recent study has found that European enterprises are lagging behind in terms of hybrid network maturity, with only 25% of organizations reporting that they have a well-defined hybrid networking strategy. This lack of maturity is hindering the adoption of new technologies and applications that require a hybrid approach, such as cloud computing and software-defined networking (SDN).

There are a number of factors contributing to the lack of hybrid network maturity in Europe. One factor is the fragmented nature of the European market, with different countries having different regulatory frameworks and technical standards. This makes it difficult for enterprises to implement a consistent hybrid networking strategy across their entire organization.

Another factor is the lack of skilled IT professionals who are experienced in hybrid networking. This skills gap is making it difficult for enterprises to find the right people to implement and manage hybrid networks.

The lack of hybrid network maturity in Europe is a significant challenge for enterprises that are looking to adopt new technologies and applications. Hybrid networks can provide a number of benefits, such as increased flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency. However, enterprises need to have a well-defined hybrid networking strategy in place in order to realize these benefits.

**Recommendations**

There are a number of things that European enterprises can do to improve their hybrid network maturity. These include:

* Developing a clear hybrid networking strategy. This strategy should define the goals and objectives of the hybrid network, as well as the technologies and vendors that will be used.
* Investing in training and education for IT professionals. This will help to ensure that enterprises have the skills and knowledge they need to implement and manage hybrid networks.
* Working with vendors to develop and support hybrid networking solutions. This will help to ensure that enterprises have access to the latest technologies and tools.

By following these recommendations, European enterprises can improve their hybrid network maturity and reap the benefits that hybrid networks can offer.

**Conclusion**

The lack of hybrid network maturity in Europe is a significant challenge for enterprises that are looking to adopt new technologies and applications. However, by following the recommendations outlined in this paper, enterprises can improve their hybrid network maturity and reap the benefits that hybrid networks can offer.
