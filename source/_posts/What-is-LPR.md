License Plate Recognition (LPR) is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates to create vehicle location data. LPR is also known as Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR).

LPR is used in various traffic and security applications, such as toll collection, parking management, and access control. LPR systems can be standalone or integrated with other systems, such as surveillance cameras and databases.

LPR systems consist of cameras, lighting, image processing software, and databases. The cameras capture images of vehicles, and the software processes the images to read the license plates. The data is then stored in databases for further analysis and retrieval.

LPR systems can be used to track vehicles in real-time, monitor traffic flow, and identify stolen or wanted vehicles. LPR technology is constantly evolving, with new features and capabilities being developed to improve accuracy and performance.

Overall, LPR is a powerful technology that has many applications in traffic and security management. It is an essential tool for law enforcement agencies, parking operators, and other organizations that need to track and manage vehicles.
