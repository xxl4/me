[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) is a technology that allows a driver to lock or unlock their vehicle without having to physically touch the key. The system uses a key fob that emits a unique radio frequency signal that is detected by the vehicle's receiver. When the driver approaches the vehicle, the receiver picks up the signal and unlocks the doors. When the driver leaves the vehicle, the receiver senses that the key fob is no longer present and locks the doors.

PKE systems offer a number of advantages over traditional key-based systems. They are more convenient, as the driver does not have to fumble with keys to lock or unlock the vehicle. They are also more secure, as the key fob is not easily lost or stolen. Additionally, PKE systems can be integrated with other vehicle security features, such as alarms and immobilizers.
