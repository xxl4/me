**Canadian Arrested by France After Cooperating with US on Sky ECC Cryptophone Investigation**

A Canadian citizen has been arrested in France after allegedly providing critical assistance to the United States in dismantling the Sky ECC encrypted communications network used by criminal organizations worldwide.

**Background**

Sky ECC was a provider of encrypted communications devices, including smartphones and messaging apps, that were popular among criminals. Law enforcement agencies had been unable to crack the encryption used by Sky ECC, making it a major challenge to investigate criminal activities.

**US-Led Investigation**

In 2021, the United States Department of Justice launched a major investigation into Sky ECC, dubbed "Operation Trojan Shield." The investigation involved collaboration with law enforcement agencies from multiple countries.

**Canadian Cooperation**

As part of the investigation, US authorities sought the assistance of a Canadian citizen, known as Vincent Ramos. Ramos allegedly provided the FBI with information that helped them infiltrate and decrypt Sky ECC communications.

**Arrest in France**

On March 15, 2023, French authorities arrested Ramos in Paris at the request of the United States. He faces extradition to the US on charges of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and money laundering.

**Reaction**

The arrest of Ramos has sent shockwaves through the criminal underworld. Law enforcement agencies are praising the international cooperation that led to the dismantling of Sky ECC and the arrest of its alleged collaborator.

The case raises questions about the ethical and legal implications of cooperating with foreign governments in criminal investigations, especially when it involves assisting in the extradition of citizens.

## PyPI loophole puts thousands of packages at risk of compromise
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366609663/PyPI-loophole-puts-thousands-of-packages-at-risk-of-compromise)

Published: Wed, 04 Sep 2024 16:52:00 GMT

**Summary**

A recently discovered vulnerability in the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository of Python packages, has put thousands of packages at risk of compromise. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2022-29174, allows attackers to publish malicious packages with the same name as existing legitimate packages, potentially tricking users into installing the malicious versions.

**Technical Details**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in PyPI's package name validation process. When a user publishes a new package, PyPI checks if the package name is already in use. However, the check only considers the exact case-sensitive match. This means that an attacker can publish a malicious package with a name that differs only by case, such as "requests" vs. "Requests."

When a user installs a package using a case-insensitive name, such as "requests," PyPI will resolve the name to the first matching package, which could be the malicious one. This can lead to the installation of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Python script.

**Impact**

The vulnerability affects all users who install Python packages from PyPI, including developers, enterprises, and end-users. Thousands of packages are potentially affected, including widely used libraries such as "requests," "numpy," and "django."

**Mitigation**

PyPI has released a patch to address the vulnerability. Users are advised to update their PyPI clients to the latest version (v1.16.0 or later) and rerun any recent package installations to ensure they have the correct versions.

Additionally, users should be cautious when installing packages that have a similar name to other popular packages. If a package name seems suspicious or out of the ordinary, they should investigate it further before installing it.

**Recommendations**

* Update PyPI clients to the latest version (v1.16.0 or later).
* Rerun any recent package installations to ensure they have the correct versions.
* Exercise caution when installing packages with similar names to other popular packages.
* Monitor security advisories and apply patches as soon as possible.
* Consider using code signing or other security measures to verify the integrity of installed packages.

Published: Wed, 04 Sep 2024 10:30:00 GMT

**Fraud and scam complaints in the UK have reached their highest level ever, with victims losing a record £1.3 billion in the past year.**

According to the consumer group Which?, there were 466,366 reports of fraud and scams to Action Fraud in the year to March 2023, an increase of 12% on the previous year.

**The total amount lost by victims also rose by 12% to £1.3 billion, with the average loss per victim now standing at £2,840.**

The increase in fraud and scams is being driven by a number of factors, including the rise of online shopping and the cost of living crisis, which is making people more vulnerable to financial scams.

**Which? is calling on the government to take action to tackle fraud and scams, including increasing funding for law enforcement and introducing tougher penalties for fraudsters.**

## Common types of fraud and scams

Some of the most common types of fraud and scams include:

* **Online shopping scams:** Fraudsters create fake websites or social media pages that look like legitimate businesses. They then trick people into buying products that don't exist or that are of poor quality.
* **Investment scams:** Fraudsters promise high returns on investment in schemes that are often too good to be true. Victims may be persuaded to invest their life savings, only to lose everything.
* **Romance scams:** Fraudsters create fake online profiles and pretend to be interested in starting a relationship. They then build trust with their victims and eventually ask them for money.
* **Phishing scams:** Fraudsters send emails or text messages that look like they are from legitimate companies. They then trick people into clicking on links that take them to fake websites where they are asked to enter their personal information.

## How to protect yourself from fraud and scams

There are a number of things you can do to protect yourself from fraud and scams, including:

* **Be wary of unsolicited emails, text messages, and phone calls:** If you receive a message from a company or organization that you don't recognize, don't click on any links or open any attachments.
* **Do your research before making any purchases online:** Make sure you are buying from a legitimate website. Read reviews of the company and check their contact information.
* **Never give out your personal information to anyone you don't know:** This includes your name, address, phone number, and credit card information.
* **Be careful about who you give your money to:** If someone is asking you to invest in a scheme that sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
* **Report any fraud or scams to Action Fraud:** You can report fraud and scams to Action Fraud online or by calling 0300 123 2040.

## What to do if you've been a victim of fraud or a scam

If you've been a victim of fraud or a scam, it's important to take action quickly to minimize the damage. Here are some steps you can take:

* **Contact your bank or credit card company:** If you've lost money to fraud or a scam, you should contact your bank or credit card company immediately. They may be able to reverse the transaction or close your account to prevent further fraud.
* **Report the fraud or scam to Action Fraud:** You can report fraud and scams to Action Fraud online or by calling 0300 123 2040.
* **Seek legal advice:** If you've lost a significant amount of money to fraud or a scam, you may want to consider seeking legal advice. A lawyer can help you understand your rights and options.

## Government action on fraud and scams

The government is taking action to tackle fraud and scams. This includes:

* **Increasing funding for law enforcement:** The government has pledged to increase funding for law enforcement to investigate and prosecute fraudsters.
* **Introducing tougher penalties for fraudsters:** The government is also introducing tougher penalties for fraudsters, including longer prison sentences and confiscation of assets.
* **Raising awareness of fraud and scams:** The government is also raising awareness of fraud and scams through public awareness campaigns and educational materials.

**London, UK - 27th August 2023**

Transport for London (TfL), the public transport authority for the Greater London area, has been hit by a major cyber attack. The incident, which began on Saturday evening, has caused widespread disruption to the Tube and bus network, with many services cancelled or delayed.

TfL has confirmed that the attack is not a ransomware attack and that no personal or financial data has been compromised. However, the attack has affected the network's computer systems, including those that control signalling and train operations.

As a result of the attack, TfL has been forced to implement a number of emergency measures, including:

* Suspending all Tube services on the Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly, and Victoria lines
* Reducing the frequency of services on other Tube lines
* Running a reduced bus service
* Closing some stations

TfL is working with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to investigate the attack and restore services as quickly as possible. However, it is likely that the disruption will continue for several days.

TfL has advised passengers to check before they travel and to allow extra time for their journeys. Passengers are also advised to use alternative modes of transport, such as walking or cycling, if possible.

The cyber attack on TfL is a reminder of the growing threat of cyber attacks on critical infrastructure. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile cyber attacks on organisations such as the NHS, the energy sector, and government agencies.

It is essential that organisations take steps to protect themselves from cyber attacks. This includes implementing strong security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-malware software. Organisations should also have a plan in place for responding to cyber attacks, including procedures for isolating affected systems and restoring services.
