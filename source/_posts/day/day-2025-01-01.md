Today is 2025 of January 1st, the first day of the year.

I went to the Company to work, and then went to the gym to exercise. I also went to the supermarket to buy some food.

The frist day of 2025 is a good day. I hope the whole year will be good. 

I will keep recording my daily life in Shanghai in 2025. 

Today's topic is the first day of 2025 in Shanghai. 

When I was young, I always thought that 2025 was a very far away year. But now, It is already 2025. Time files so fast. I am getting older and older. 

I want i can keep recording my daily life in endless time. I am not sure if I can do it. But I will try my best.

In 2025, my wish is to be healthy and happy. I hope i can achieve my goal.

1) Keep recording my daily life in 2025.
2) Keep studying and working hard.
3) Keep healthy and happy.
4) Keep learning new things.
5) To keep myself in a good mood.

2024 is not a good year for me, or for the whole world. 

In 2020 and 2024, the COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading around the world. Many people are infected and died. The world economy is in a recession. Many people lost their jobs. Many companies went bankrupt. Many people are suffering.

When a people not have a job, he will lose his hope. He will lose his confidence. He will lose his future. specially for the middle-aged people that have a family to support.

In china, when a people lost his job, he must to face the pressure from his family. He must to face the pressure from the society. It is very hard for him to find a new job.
