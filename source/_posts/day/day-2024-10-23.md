I wake up early and go for a walk to the the company for work. The streets are so many people and cars. The city is bustling with activity as people go about their day.

I arrive at the office and start my work. I have a lot of tasks to do today, but I'm feeling motivated and ready to tackle them. I put on my headphones and start coding. The day goes by quickly as I work on my projects and collaborate with my team.

I check the monitoring and the alerts are working. I check the scaling and the resources are optimized. I check the costs and the budget is on track.
