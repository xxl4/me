Today is Monday. When i finished my work, it was already 8:30pm. I was so tired that i just wanted to go home and have a good rest. I took the subway and went back home. I had a simple dinner outside and then went back home.

When i got home, i found that my son was studying in his room. My wife was in my son's room, helping him with his homework. Maybe today's homework is too difficult for my son, so my wife was helping him. My son is crying because he can't do his homework. I feel so sorry for him. I think i should spend more time with him and help him with his homework. I will try my best to help him with his homework in the ftuure.

My Erp project was not going well. I was so worried about it. and i don't have more time to spend with my erp project. I need to find a way to solve this problem. I will try my best to solve this problem in the future.
