Today I don't go to company, I stay at home and work on project. The Boss maybe not happy, but i don't care. I need cost more time to my son. He is very happy when I stay with him. I think I will do this more often.

When i am working on project, my wife give me a call. She said the car is broken, and she need me to help her. I have to stop my work and go to help her.

When i got to the place, I found the car's battery is not have power. I have to call the car service to help us. After 30 minutes, the car service come and help us to start the car. Becase i use the car service, so i don't need to pay for the battery. I am very happy.

But my wife worry about the car that maybe have the same problem again. So i tell her, i will check the car tomorrow. I think i need to buy a new battery for the car, or go to the 4S shop to check the car. when i tell my wife, she is very happy.

After that, we go home together. and put the car in the garage. and don't take off the car key. Becase i need to charge the battery.

When we back to home, my son is very happy. He said he is very happy when we are together. 

Today is my son birthday party, so we have to prepare for the party. I think i need to buy some gift for my son. I think he will like the gift. I will go to the shopping mall to buy the gift tomorrow.
