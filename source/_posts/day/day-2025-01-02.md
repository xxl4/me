# Shanghai 2025.01.02

Today is a sunny day in Shanghai. But it's cold outside. I went to the company to work. I had a plan need to be finished today. I worked hard and wanted to finish it as soon as possible. I had lunch and dinner in the company. I went back home at 9:10 pm. I was tired and went to bed at 12:20 pm. I hope I can live a better life tomorrow.

I don't feel well today. Maybe I am too tired. I need to have a good rest. I hope I can have a good sleep tonight. and Now i need wait my wife finish her work and go to bed, and then i check all the things and go to bed.

Today's Topic: marriage life

My wife married me for more than 10 years. We have a good life. But when we face some problems, we always have some conflicts. I think it's normal. We need to communicate more and understand each other. I hope we can live a better life in the future. I love my wife, I love my family. I will try my best to make my family happy.

But when i found my son is not happy, i feel very sad. i can't control myself. I need to do something to do. 

At now, my all hope is my son can have a good life. I will try my best to make him strong and happy. I hope he can have a good future. I love my son. I love my family. I will try my best to make my family happy.
