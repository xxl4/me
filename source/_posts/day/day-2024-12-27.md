Today is a sunny day in Shanghai. When i had lunch, i saw the sun was shining through the window. It was so warm and comfortable. I felt so happy and peaceful. I hope the sun will always shine on me.
I love sunshine. I love Shanghai.

I go to the riverside to see the sunset. The sun is setting. The sky is so beautiful. The river is so quiet. I feel so peaceful. I hope the sun will always shine on me.

And now. I finish my rest. I go back to work. 

Today our topic is about the future of the world. I think the future of the world is bright. I think the future of the world is beautiful. I think the future of the world is peaceful. I hope the future of the world will always be bright, beautiful and peaceful.

I love the world. I love Shanghai. I love Life. But now, i have something is not good. Many dreams are broken. Many hopes are gone. How can i do? I don't know. I feel so sad. I hope the sun will always shine on me.

I am a little tired. I want to sleep.
