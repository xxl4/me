## Shanghai 2025 04 30

Today is the last day of April 2025. The weather in Shanghai is warm and sunny, perfect for a stroll along the Bund. The cherry blossoms are in full bloom, creating a picturesque scene.

I got up early to enjoy the morning sun. After breakfast. I decided to take a walk along the Road. I always enjoy the fresh air and the sound of the birds chirping. The flowers are blooming, and the trees are lush green. It's a beautiful sight.

And now I see why many people love to flower, fish, when you see the flowers blooming, you feel a sense of peace and tranquility. It's a reminder of the beauty of nature and the simple pleasures in life.
