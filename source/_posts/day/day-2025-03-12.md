Today is a rainy day. I woke up at 6:30 am and washed my face. I went to office at 7:30 am. 

I buy a egg for breakfast. I have so many work to do. I have to finish most of them today. I have to work hard.

I have lunch at 12:00 pm. I have a meeting at 3:00 pm. I have to prepare for the meeting. I have to finish most of the work before the end of the day.

Today is a busy day, but i offer to help my colleague to finish his work. 

Today i design a new cache system for our ecommerce application. and i use the cache tag to cache the data. and clear the cache when the data is updated.

When i push the code to the production server, i found that the cache is not working. I have to check the code and fix the bug. Oh, i found that i use the worng cache key. when you use cache tag, you have to use the cache tag method to get the cache key and check the cache key in the cache system.

I use redis as the cache system. I use the cache tag to cache the data. add the event for the data update. when the data is updated, i clear the cache by the cache tag.

I finish the work at 8:00 pm. I go home at 8:30 pm. I have dinner at 9:00 pm.
