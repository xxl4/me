Today, I went to Jiangsu zhengjiang, and took the PETS test. It was rainy. I have arrived at the test at 3:00 am. 

But the pets test will be held at 8:30 am. So i need to wait for 5 hours. and i don't have space to sleep. So i just tell car driver to find a place to sleep.

The car driver find a place of KFC. I site in the KFC and sleep for 3 hours. Then i wake up and go to the test place. The test place is in a school. The place is very big. and beautiful. The school is built in the mountain. The air is very fresh. I like the place. Becase the place is in mountain, so i don't have more place chose to eat. So i don't have breakfast. 

Today, we can discuss the topic of the pets test, and why i need to do the pets test. The pets test is a test of English. It is a test of English level. It is a test of English listening, speaking, reading and writing. The test is very important for me. Because i need to finished my study in college. And i need to go to the university. So i need to pass the test.
