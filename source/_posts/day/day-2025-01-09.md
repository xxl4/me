Today is a sunny cold day in Shanghai. The temperature is around -3°C to 5°C. The air is fresh and clean. 

I woke up at 6:30 am. I did my morning routine. I had my breakfast at 8:20 am. I had a cup of coffee, a bowl of rice porridge, and a fried egg.

When i got to the office, it was 8:30 am. But the power was off. I had to wait for worker to fix it. when we are waiting, we had a small chat. I learned that he is from Anhui province. He has been working in Shanghai for 5 years. He has a wife and a twin daughters.

The power was fixed at 9:30 am. I started to work. I had a meeting with my team at 10:00 am. We discussed about the project progress and the plan for next week.
