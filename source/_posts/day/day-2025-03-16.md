Today is a sunny day. I participated in the marathon in Daning Park. This is my first marathon. I am very excited. I have been looking forward to this day for a long time. I have been training for this day for a long time. I have been preparing for this day for a long time. I have been dreaming of this day for a long time. Today, my dream came true. I am very happy. I am very proud of myself. I am very grateful to my family, my friends, my colleagues, my coach, and everyone who has helped me. I am very grateful to the organizers of the marathon. I am very grateful to the volunteers. I am very grateful to the spectators. I am very grateful to everyone. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

I run with my colleagues. We encourage each other. We help each other. We cheer for each other. We laugh and cry together. We share the joy and pain together. We are a team.
