* Cloud IAM supports MFA to verify user identities through multiple factors, reducing the risk of account compromise.
* Ensures that even if a user's password is compromised, access is still restricted.

**3. Continuous Authorization:**
* Cloud IAM continuously evaluates access requests based on the user's context (e.g., IP address, device).
* Revokes access promptly if the user's context changes or suspicious activity is detected.

**4. Device Fingerprinting:**
* Cloud IAM can fingerprint devices used to access cloud resources.
* Blocks unauthorized devices from accessing sensitive data, even if the user account is compromised.

**5. Just-in-Time (JIT) Access:**
* Cloud IAM can provide just-in-time access to resources.
* Grants access temporarily, only when necessary, and revokes it afterwards.

**6. Identity Federation:**
* Cloud IAM can federate with identity providers (e.g., Active Directory).
* Ensures that users do not need to create separate accounts for cloud resources, reducing the risk of password reuse.

**7. Logging and Auditing:**
* Cloud IAM provides comprehensive logging and auditing capabilities.
* Tracks user access, resource modifications, and suspicious activities, facilitating threat detection and response.

**Benefits of Aligning Cloud IAM with Zero Trust:**

* **Enhanced Security:** Reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
* **Improved Compliance:** Meets regulatory and industry standards that require zero-trust principles.
* **Reduced Attack Surface:** Limits the potential entry points for attackers.
* **Improved Incident Response:** Facilitates rapid detection and remediation of security incidents.
* **Increased Trust:** Strengthens the credibility and reliability of cloud-based systems.

The UK government has announced plans to introduce a new law requiring organizations to report significant cyber incidents to the government. The law, which is expected to come into effect in 2025, aims to improve the UK's ability to respond to and prevent cyber threats.

Under the new law, organizations will be required to report any cyber incident that has a "significant impact" on their operations or the UK's national security. This includes incidents such as data breaches, ransomware attacks, and denial-of-service attacks.

Organizations will have 72 hours to report a cyber incident to the government. The government will then assess the incident and decide whether to take any further action.

The new law is part of the UK government's wider strategy to improve the country's cybersecurity. The government has also committed to investing £1.9 billion in cybersecurity over the next four years.

The new law has been welcomed by cybersecurity experts, who believe it will help to improve the UK's ability to defend against cyber threats. However, some businesses have expressed concerns about the potential cost and administrative burden of the new law.

The government has said that it will work with businesses to ensure that the new law is implemented in a way that minimizes the burden on businesses. The government has also said that it will provide support to businesses that are affected by cyber incidents.

Multiple DrayTek routers used by UK telcos, including BT, are vulnerable to cyberattacks due to critical security flaws, putting their customers at risk.

According to a report by security firm NCC Group, multiple DrayTek router models, including the Vigor 2860 series, 2925 series, 3220 series, 3900 series, and the VigorSwitch P1000 series, contain critical vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to compromise the devices and the networks they are connected to.

The security issues include improper input validation, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted router, remote code execution (RCE) flaws, command injection vulnerabilities, cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, and insufficient authentication and authorization controls.

"If exploited, these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the router, modify its configuration, execute arbitrary code, and launch further attacks on the network," the NCC Group report states. "These vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to the security of the affected routers and the networks they are connected to."

The report also notes that the affected DrayTek routers are widely used by UK telcos, including BT, and are often used for business-critical applications such as broadband connectivity, VPN access, and network management.

"The exploitation of these vulnerabilities could have a significant impact on the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the networks and services provided by UK telcos," the report warns.

NCC Group has notified DrayTek of the vulnerabilities and the company has released firmware updates to address the issues. However, it is important for users of affected DrayTek routers to apply the updates as soon as possible to protect their devices and networks from cyberattacks.

In addition to applying the firmware updates, users can take other steps to mitigate the risk of cyberattacks, including using strong passwords, disabling unused services and ports, and keeping software up to date.

**NCSC celebrates eight years as Horne blows in**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is celebrating its eighth anniversary today, as Ciaran Martin departs as its chief executive.

The NCSC was established in October 2016 to protect the UK from cyber attacks and provide advice to businesses and individuals on how to stay safe online.

In its eight years, the NCSC has responded to a number of major cyber incidents, including the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 and the SolarWinds supply chain attack in 2020.

The NCSC has also played a key role in developing the UK's national cyber security strategy and in working with international partners to combat cyber threats.

Ciaran Martin, who has led the NCSC since its inception, is stepping down today. He will be replaced by Lindy Cameron, who is currently the NCSC's deputy director for operations.

Martin said: "It has been an honour to lead the NCSC for the past eight years. The centre has made a real difference to the UK's cyber security, and I am proud of the work that we have done.

"I am confident that Lindy Cameron will be an excellent successor and that the NCSC will continue to play a vital role in protecting the UK from cyber threats."

Lindy Cameron said: "I am delighted to be taking over as CEO of the NCSC. The centre has a world-class reputation and I am looking forward to working with the team to build on the success of the past eight years.

"Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and it is more important than ever that we have a strong and effective NCSC to protect the UK from these threats."

**Cups Linux Printing Bugs Open Door to DDoS Attacks, Says Akamai**

Akamai, a content delivery network provider, recently identified a series of vulnerabilities in the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) that can be exploited to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

**Vulnerabilities Overview:**

The vulnerabilities reside in CUPS's handling of Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) requests:

* **CVE-2022-38373:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in CUPS can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
* **CVE-2022-38374:** A denial-of-service vulnerability in CUPS can cause the printer service to crash when processing certain IPP requests.

**Exploitation:**

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted IPP requests to a vulnerable CUPS server. This could cause the server to crash or execute malicious code, leading to the disruption of printing services and potentially a larger DDoS attack.

**Impact:**

The vulnerabilities can impact any system running CUPS, including printers, multifunction devices, and servers. This includes various Linux distributions, embedded devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

**Mitigations:**

Akamai recommends that users and administrators apply the following mitigations:

* Update CUPS to the latest version (2.4.0 or higher).
* Enable IPP authentication and only allow trusted clients to access the printing service.
* Restrict access to the printing service from external networks.
* Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive IPP requests.

**Additional Considerations:**

* The vulnerabilities can also be exploited to conduct phishing attacks by sending malicious IPP requests that prompt the user to install software or click on links.
* Researchers have developed proof-of-concept exploits for these vulnerabilities, highlighting the potential risk.

**Conclusion:**

It is crucial for organizations to apply the recommended mitigations promptly to protect their systems from potential DDoS attacks and other malicious activities. Keeping CUPS and other software up to date is essential for maintaining a secure environment.
