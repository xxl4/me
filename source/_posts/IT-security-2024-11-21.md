**Strengthening Cybersecurity: Best IAM Practices to Combat Threats**

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** plays a crucial role in protecting organizations from cyber threats by controlling who has access to what resources. Implementing best IAM practices is essential to mitigate risks and ensure data security.

**1. Implement Strong Authentication:**
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
- Enforce password complexity requirements and regular password resets.

**2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- Assign users and systems specific roles and permissions based on their job functions or requirements.
- Implement the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary access.

**3. Enforce Just-in-Time (JIT) Access:**
- Grant access to resources only when needed and automatically revoke it when no longer required.
- Monitor user activity for suspicious behaviors or unauthorized access attempts.

**4. Privileged Access Management (PAM):**
- Create separate accounts for privileged users and implement safeguards to control their access.
- Use privilege escalation tools to minimize the exposure of administrative privileges.

**5. Automated Provisioning and Deprovisioning:**
- Automate the creation, modification, and removal of user accounts based on business rules.
- Ensure timely provisioning and deprovisioning to prevent unauthorized access or orphaned accounts.

**6. Single Sign-on (SSO):**
- Allow users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials.
- Reduce password fatigue and improve the user experience while enhancing security.

**7. Continuous Monitoring and Auditing:**
- Regularly monitor user activity and system logs for anomalous behavior or security breaches.
- Conduct periodic audits to ensure IAM controls are implemented effectively and in accordance with best practices.

**8. Employee Security Awareness Training:**
- Educate employees about cybersecurity risks and their role in protecting sensitive data.
- Encourage users to report suspicious activities or potential vulnerabilities.

**9. Integration with Security Tools:**
- Integrate IAM systems with other security tools, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.
- Use security orchestration and automation (SOAR) platforms to automate IAM-related tasks and improve efficiency.

**10. Regular Review and Updates:**
- Periodically review and update IAM policies, procedures, and technologies to keep pace with evolving threats.
- Stay informed about the latest industry best practices and regulatory requirements.

By implementing these best IAM practices, organizations can significantly strengthen their cybersecurity posture and reduce the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and other cyber threats.

**Fresh Concerns Over NHS England Registries Procurement**

**London, UK** - NHS England's procurement of national health registries has raised further concerns, following an investigation by the National Audit Office (NAO).

**Lack of Transparency and Competition**

The NAO report found that NHS England's procurement process lacked transparency and competition. The contract was awarded to a single supplier, IQVIA, without a competitive bidding process. This raised concerns about the value for money achieved and the potential for conflicts of interest.

**Data Security Risks**

The NAO also highlighted concerns about data security risks associated with the registries. The data collected includes sensitive patient information, and the contract awarded to IQVIA does not adequately address data protection requirements.

**Lack of Regulatory Oversight**

Furthermore, the report found that there was a lack of regulatory oversight of the registries. NHS England had not established a clear governance framework for managing the registries, and the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) had not been adequately consulted during the procurement process.

**Impact on Patients and the NHS**

The concerns over the registries procurement have raised questions about the quality and reliability of the data they collect. This could have implications for patient care and decision-making in the NHS.

**Next Steps**

NHS England has responded to the NAO report, stating that it will review the procurement process and address the concerns raised. The ICO has also announced that it will investigate the data protection risks associated with the registries.

**Implications**

The fresh concerns over NHS England's registries procurement underscore the importance of transparency, competition, and regulatory oversight in the procurement of public services. It remains to be seen whether NHS England can effectively address these concerns and ensure the integrity of the national health registries.
