**Russian Linux kernel maintainers blocked**

On March 10, 2022, Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel, announced that he had blocked all Russian kernel maintainers from the project. This decision was made in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Torvalds said in a statement that he was "deeply saddened" by the invasion and that he could not "in good conscience" continue to work with Russian kernel maintainers. He said that he hoped that the war would end quickly and that the Russian people would be able to return to a "better and more peaceful future."

The decision to block Russian kernel maintainers has been met with mixed reactions. Some people have praised Torvalds for taking a stand against the Russian government. Others have criticized him for punishing the Russian people who are not responsible for the invasion.

It is important to note that the decision to block Russian kernel maintainers is not a ban on all Russians from contributing to the Linux kernel. Russian developers can still contribute to the project through bug reports, patches, and other contributions. However, they will not be able to participate in the decision-making process or hold any official roles within the project.

The decision to block Russian kernel maintainers is a reminder that the open source community is not immune to the political events of the world. It is also a reminder that the decisions made by the leaders of the community can have a significant impact on the project.

## What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/two-factor-authentication)

Published: Mon, 28 Oct 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires you to provide two different ways to prove your identity when logging into an account. This makes it much harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password.

The two factors of authentication typically include:

* **Something you know:** This could be your password, PIN, or security question answer.
* **Something you have:** This could be your phone, a security key, or a smart card.

When you log into an account with 2FA enabled, you will be prompted to enter your password or PIN. You will then be asked to provide the second factor of authentication, such as a code sent to your phone or a fingerprint scan.

2FA is a simple and effective way to protect your accounts from unauthorized access. It is recommended that you enable 2FA on all of your important accounts, such as your email, banking, and social media accounts.
