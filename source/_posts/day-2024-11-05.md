Today my laywer called me and told me a bad news. He had read my police record and said that you maybe be not good for you, and you alway have to be careful. I was so sad and I don't know what to do.

When you frist time to face the law, you will feel so bad and you will feel so sad. I don't know what to do, I just want to be a good person and I don't want to do anything bad. But I don't know why I always do something wrong.

The Police record is a very important thing for me, and I don't want to have a bad record. I will try my best to be a good person and I will try my best to do everything right. I hope I can do it.

But I know it is not easy, and when you live in this world, you will face many things that you don't like. But you have to face it and you have to do everything right. I will try my best to do it.

I will 2024-11-14 to DongPing Taian, if you will find i have new post, that is mean i am safe. If you don't see my new post, that is mean i am not safe. I hope you can help me and I hope you can pray for me. I will try my best to do everything right.

In my world, if my family is safe, that is my best wish. I hope my family can be safe and I hope my family can be happy. 

When I am young, I see my monther always cry, and I don't know why. But now I know, because she is very pain and she is very sad. The life is not easy, and you have to face many things that you don't like. But you have to face it and you have to do everything right. I will try my best to do it.

Use a china old saying: 天降大任于斯人也，必先苦其心志，劳其筋骨，饿其体肤，空乏其身，行拂乱其所为，所以动心忍性，曾益其所不能。

I Hope My wife and my son always happy and safe. I hope my family can be safe and I hope my family can be happy. I will try my best to do everything right. I hope you can help me and I hope you can pray for me. I will try my best to do everything right.
