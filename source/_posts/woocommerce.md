### How to Develop a Woocommerce Module

To develop a Woocommerce module, you need to have a good understanding of PHP, Wordpress, and Woocommerce. Here are the steps to develop a Woocommerce module:

1. Create a new PHP file in your Wordpress theme or plugin directory.

3. Test the module to make sure it works correctly.
4. Upload the module to your Wordpress website.

Here is an example of a simple Woocommerce module that adds a new product category to your online store:

```php
<?php
function custom_product_category() {
    register_taxonomy(
        'product_category',
        'product',
        array(
            'label' => __( 'Product Category' ),
            'rewrite' => array( 'slug' => 'product-category' ),
            'hierarchical' => true,
        )
    );
}
add_action( 'init', 'custom_product_category' );
?>
