Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, a traditional Chinese festival. It's the second day of the festival, and it's raining. I'm not in the mood to celebrate. I'm not in the mood to do anything. I'm just sitting here, staring at the raindrops on the window, feeling empty and lost.

Our family used to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival together. We would have a big dinner, eat mooncakes, and watch the full moon, but that was a long time ago. Now, my monther is gone, and my father is at the place of origin. My borther is in another city. i live with my wife and my Son. We are a small family, but we are so happy.

I miss my mother. I miss her smile, her laughter, her warmth. I miss the way she used to hold me when I was sad, the way she used to scold me when was naughty. I miss her cooking, her stories, her songs. I miss everything about her. My Month is a great woman, she is a farmer, she is a mother, she is a wife, she is a daughter, she is a sister.

I wish she was here with me today. I wish I could hug her, talk to her, tell her how much I love her. I wish I could see her smile, hear her laughter, feel her warmth. I wish I could eat her mooncakes, watch the full moon with her, celebrate the festival with her. I wish I could turn back time, go back to the days when she was still here, when we were still together, when everything was still perfect.
