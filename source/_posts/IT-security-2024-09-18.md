**NCSC and Allies Condemn Russia's Cyber Warfare Operations**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of the United Kingdom, along with its allies, has issued a statement condemning Russia's malicious cyber activity, particularly that carried out by Unit 29155 of the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU.

**Unit 29155's Cyber Warfare Activities**

Unit 29155 is known for its involvement in numerous significant cyberattacks, including the following:

* **2015 BlackEnergy attack:** Disrupted power and internet services in Ukraine.
* **2016 Demokraciya hack:** Targeted U.S. presidential candidates and political organizations.
* **2017 NotPetya ransomware attack:** Caused billions of dollars in damage worldwide.
* **2022 SolarWinds supply chain attack:** Compromised software used by numerous government agencies and corporations.

**NCSC's Assessment**

The NCSC states that Unit 29155 "acts as a cyber proxy for the Russian state" and "has a history of carrying out cyber operations that destabilize, disrupt, and degrade target organizations and governments."

**Call for Action**

The NCSC and its allies urge other countries to:

* Enhance cybersecurity measures to protect critical infrastructure and systems from cyberattacks.
* Share information and intelligence on Russia's cyber activities.
* Hold Russia accountable for its malicious cyber behavior.
* Support international efforts to strengthen cyberspace stability and security.

**Impact on Russia**

The public exposure of Unit 29155's activities is likely to have a negative impact on Russia's reputation as a responsible actor in cyberspace. It may also lead to increased international pressure on Russia to cease its cyber warfare operations.

**Conclusion**

The NCSC and its allies are taking a strong stance against Russia's malicious cyber activity. The condemnation of Unit 29155 highlights the ongoing threat posed by state-sponsored cyberattacks and the need for international cooperation to address it.

**Fog Ransomware Gang Expands Operations, Posing Serious Threat**

The Fog ransomware gang has been observed broadening its attack tactics, posing a significant threat to organizations worldwide. This evolution has been alarming cybersecurity experts.

**Ransomware Tactics:**

* **Traditional Encryption:** Fog encrypts sensitive files and demands payment for decryption.
* **Double Extortion:** The gang also steals data before encrypting it, threatening to release it publicly if payment is not made.
* **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS):** Fog offers its ransomware as a service to affiliates, allowing them to launch attacks under the Fog banner.

**New Capabilities:**

* **Network Exploitation:** The gang has developed capabilities to exploit network vulnerabilities, gaining access to systems without relying on phishing or malware.
* **Credential Theft:** Fog is also using techniques to steal credentials, giving them higher privileges within compromised networks.
* **Data Exfiltration:** The gang is exfiltrating large volumes of data from victim systems, increasing the potential for sensitive information disclosure.

**Industry Impacts:**

* **Healthcare:** Fog has targeted healthcare organizations, disrupting patient care and compromising sensitive medical records.
* **Financial:** The gang has also attacked financial institutions, stealing and encrypting critical financial data.
* **Critical Infrastructure:** Fog has the potential to target critical infrastructure sectors, such as energy and transportation, posing significant risks to public safety.

**Recommendations:**

To mitigate the threat of Fog ransomware, organizations are advised to:

* Strengthen network security by patching vulnerabilities and implementing firewalls.
* Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect credentials.
* Regularly back up data and store it offline to prevent loss in case of an attack.
* Educate employees on phishing and other social engineering tactics.
* Engage with incident response teams to prepare for and respond to potential attacks.

**Ongoing Investigation:**

Law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity firms continue to investigate the Fog ransomware gang. The gang has been linked to several high-profile attacks, and experts expect its operations to continue evolving.

The Fog ransomware gang's expansion into a wide-ranging threat underscores the need for organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and implement robust defenses. By staying vigilant and taking proactive measures, institutions can minimize the risk of falling victim to this increasingly sophisticated threat.

## Canadian arrested by France after cooperating with US on Sky ECC cryptophone investigation

**Canadian Arrested by France after Cooperating with US on Sky ECC Cryptophone Investigation**

On November 11, 2022, French authorities arrested a 34-year-old Canadian man named Vincent Ramos in Paris. The arrest was made as part of an ongoing investigation into Sky ECC, an encrypted messaging platform used by criminal organizations worldwide.

**Cooperation with US Law Enforcement**

Ramos' arrest stems from his cooperation with US law enforcement in the investigation of Sky ECC. In March 2021, the US Department of Justice announced that it had seized the Sky ECC network and decrypted millions of messages.

Ramos had allegedly provided information to US investigators about the operation of Sky ECC and its use by criminal groups. This information reportedly helped US authorities identify and prosecute individuals involved in various criminal activities.

**French Investigation**

The French investigation into Sky ECC began after the US provided information about the network to French law enforcement agencies. The French police have been investigating the use of Sky ECC by criminal organizations in France, particularly for drug trafficking and money laundering.

**Arrest in Paris**

Ramos was arrested in Paris after French authorities obtained a European arrest warrant. He was reportedly scheduled to appear before a French judge to face charges related to his alleged involvement in the illegal use of Sky ECC.

**Significance of the Arrest**

The arrest of Ramos highlights the growing international cooperation in combating criminal activity facilitated by encrypted messaging platforms. It also demonstrates the importance of whistleblower protection, as Ramos' information has assisted law enforcement agencies in various jurisdictions.

The investigation into Sky ECC is ongoing, and further arrests are expected. The impact of this investigation on criminal organizations and the use of encrypted messaging for illicit activities remains to be seen.
