[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE) is a system that allows a person to unlock and start a vehicle without using a traditional key. Instead, the person carries a key fob or other device that emits a radio signal. When the person approaches the vehicle, the signal is detected by an antenna on the vehicle, which then unlocks the doors and allows the person to start the vehicle.

PKE systems are becoming increasingly common on new vehicles. They offer a number of benefits over traditional keys, including:

* **Convenience:** PKE systems are much more convenient than traditional keys. There is no need to fumble for a key or insert it into a lock. Simply carrying the key fob or other device is enough to unlock and start the vehicle.
* **Security:** PKE systems are also more secure than traditional keys. The radio signal is encrypted, which makes it very difficult for thieves to intercept it and unlock the vehicle.

The NCSC, a part of GCHQ, is the UK's national authority for cyber security. It works to make the UK the safest place in the world to live and do business online. The NCSC provides advice and support to businesses, individuals, and the government on how to protect themselves from cyber threats.

On October 12th, 2022, the NCSC, along with its allies in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, attributed cyber attacks to Unit 29155 of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU. These attacks targeted critical infrastructure, including energy, water, and telecommunications, in Ukraine and other countries.

The NCSC assessed that Unit 29155 was responsible for the following cyber attacks:

* The Industroyer2 attack on the Ukrainian power grid in 2016
* The NotPetya attack on global targets in 2017
* The Triton/Trisis attack on Saudi Arabian petrochemical facilities in 2018
* The recent attacks on Ukrainian government and military websites

The NCSC also assessed that Unit 29155 is likely to continue targeting critical infrastructure in Ukraine and other countries. The NCSC urged organizations to take steps to protect themselves from these attacks, such as implementing strong cybersecurity measures and patching software vulnerabilities.

The attribution of these attacks to Unit 29155 is a significant development in the fight against cyber warfare. It shows that the international community is increasingly willing to call out state-sponsored cyber attacks and hold the perpetrators accountable.

**Canadian Arrested by France after Assisting US in Sky ECC Investigation**

**Paris, France** - A Canadian citizen has been arrested in France for allegedly collaborating with the United States in the investigation of Sky ECC, a secure messaging platform used by criminal organizations.

The suspect, identified as Jean-Philippe Amzallag, was taken into custody on March 4th at his home in the suburbs of Paris. The arrest was made by French police acting on a request from the United States Department of Justice.

**Allegations of Cooperation with the US**

Amzallag is accused of providing the US authorities with access to a secret Sky ECC server, which contained encrypted communications from organized crime groups around the world. By accessing the server, the US was able to intercept and decipher countless messages, leading to the arrest of hundreds of individuals.

**Crackdown on Sky ECC**

Sky ECC was a popular communication tool among criminals due to its robust encryption and anonymity features. In 2021, a joint operation between international law enforcement agencies led to the takedown of Sky ECC's servers, resulting in the seizure of millions of messages.

**International Cooperation**

The arrest of Amzallag highlights the increasing cooperation between law enforcement agencies in combating transnational crime. The French authorities have stated that they will continue to work closely with their international partners to disrupt criminal networks.

**Amzallag's Legal Status**

Amzallag is currently being held in custody in France while awaiting his extradition hearing. The United States has requested his extradition to face charges of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and money laundering.

**Impact on Criminal Networks**

The disruption of Sky ECC has been a significant blow to organized crime groups worldwide. The loss of their secure communication platform has made it more difficult for them to coordinate their criminal activities. The arrest of Amzallag is another step towards dismantling these networks and holding their members accountable.
