[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as keyless entry or proximity keyless entry, is a system that allows a person to unlock and start a vehicle without using a physical key.

**How PKE Works:**

* **Key Fob:** The key fob contains a transponder chip that emits a unique radio frequency (RF) signal.
* **Antenna:** The vehicle has an antenna located in or around the door handles or steering column that receives the RF signal.
* **Receiver:** An electronic receiver in the vehicle decodes the signal and verifies it against a stored code.
* **Vehicle Response:** If the signal matches the stored code, the receiver sends a command to unlock the doors or start the engine.

**Key Features of PKE:**

* **Convenience:** Allows for entry and startup without the need to fumble for keys.
* **Enhanced Security:** Eliminates the risk of stolen keys or key duplication.
* **Hands-free Operation:** Doors can be unlocked and locked by simply touching the door handles.
* **Passive Operation:** The key fob does not need to be actively used or pressed; it just needs to be within proximity to the vehicle.

**Additional Features:**

* **Panic Button:** In case of an emergency, the key fob can be used to sound the vehicle's horn or turn on the hazard lights.
* **Remote Start:** Some PKE systems allow for remote starting of the vehicle from a distance.
* **Trunk Release:** The key fob can be used to open the trunk without the need for a physical key.

**Security Concerns:**

While PKE provides convenience and security, there are potential security concerns that should be considered:

* **Relay Attacks:** Cybercriminals can use relay devices to amplify the signal from the key fob, allowing them to unlock and start vehicles from a distance.
* **Code Grabbing:** Devices can be used to capture the RF signal emitted by the key fob and use it to create duplicate keys.
* **Phishing Attacks:** Scammers may send emails or text messages asking for PKE codes, which they can then use to access vehicles.

To mitigate these concerns, it is important to keep PKE key fobs secure, use anti-theft devices, and beware of suspicious activity.
