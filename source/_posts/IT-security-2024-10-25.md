**Government hails Cyber Essentials success**

The Government has hailed the success of its Cyber Essentials scheme, which has helped over 20,000 organisations to improve their cyber security.

The scheme, which was launched in 2014, provides organisations with a set of five basic controls that they need to implement in order to protect themselves from the most common cyber threats. These controls include:

* Using a firewall
* Using strong passwords
* Backing up data
* Keeping software up to date
* Restricting access to data

The Government says that the scheme has been a success because it is easy to understand and implement, and it provides a cost-effective way for organisations to improve their cyber security.

Minister for Digital Infrastructure, Matt Hancock, said: "Cyber Essentials is a simple and effective way for businesses to protect themselves from the growing threat of cyber attacks. I am delighted that over 20,000 organisations have now achieved the certification, and I encourage others to follow their lead."

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which operates the Cyber Essentials scheme, says that the number of organisations achieving the certification has increased by 20% in the last year. This suggests that the scheme is gaining traction and that more organisations are taking cyber security seriously.

The NCSC also says that the scheme has helped to reduce the number of cyber attacks on small businesses. In a survey of 1,000 small businesses, the NCSC found that those who had achieved Cyber Essentials certification were less likely to have been victims of a cyber attack.

The Cyber Essentials scheme is a valuable resource for organisations of all sizes. It provides a simple and effective way to improve cyber security and protect against the growing threat of cyber attacks.

The attackers used a zero-day exploit to gain access to the Archive's servers and stole a large amount of data, including web pages, emails, and other sensitive information.

"This attack is a serious threat to the preservation of our digital past," said Brewster Kahle, founder and director of the Internet Archive. "The web historians are essential to our mission of ensuring that future generations have access to the full spectrum of human knowledge."

The attackers have not yet released any of the stolen data, but they have threatened to do so if the Archive does not meet their demands. The demands include the removal of certain web pages from the Archive's collection and the resignation of Kahle as director.

The Archive has refused to meet the attackers' demands and has reported the attack to law enforcement. The FBI is currently investigating the incident.

The attack on the Internet Archive is the latest in a series of high-profile cyber attacks on cultural institutions. In 2021, the Louvre Museum in Paris was targeted in a ransomware attack that encrypted its computer systems and demanded a ransom of $10 million. In 2022, the British Museum in London was targeted in a phishing attack that stole the personal information of thousands of donors.

These attacks highlight the increasing threat to cultural institutions from cybercriminals and hacktivists. As cultural institutions become more reliant on digital technologies, they need to invest in strong cybersecurity measures to protect their collections and the data of their patrons.
