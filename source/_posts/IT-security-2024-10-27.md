The government has launched a new cyber security standard specifically designed for local authorities. The standard, known as the Cyber Essentials for Local Government (CELG), is intended to help councils protect themselves from cyber threats and improve their overall cyber resilience.

**Key Features of CELG**

* **Five key controls:** CELG is based on the five key controls from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)'s Cyber Essentials scheme:
    * Firewalls and Internet Gateways
    * Secure Configuration
    * Access Control and User Authentication
    * Malware Protection
    * Patch Management

* **Tailored for local authorities:** CELG includes additional guidance and resources specific to the challenges faced by local authorities, such as the protection of sensitive data and the need to meet regulatory requirements.

* **Self-assessment tool:** CELG provides a self-assessment tool that allows local authorities to assess their current cyber security posture and identify areas for improvement.

**Benefits of CELG**

* **Improved cyber security:** By implementing CELG, local authorities can significantly improve their cyber security defenses and reduce the risk of cyber attacks.

* **Enhanced resilience:** CELG helps local authorities build a more resilient cyber security infrastructure that can withstand and recover from cyber incidents.

* **Compliance with regulations:** CELG aligns with relevant regulations and standards, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive.

* **Easier insurance coverage:** Some insurance providers may offer more favorable terms to local authorities that have implemented CELG.

**Adoption and Support**

CELG is voluntary, but local authorities are strongly encouraged to adopt it. The government has provided funding to support local authorities that need assistance with implementing CELG.

The NCSC and the Local Government Association (LGA) will provide ongoing support and guidance to local authorities through webinars, workshops, and other resources.

**Conclusion**

The launch of the Cyber Essentials for Local Government standard is a significant step towards improving the cyber security of local authorities and protecting the sensitive data they hold. By implementing CELG, councils can enhance their cyber resilience, meet regulatory requirements, and ultimately provide better services to their communities.

**Internet Archive Web Historians Target of Hacktivist Cyber Attack**

**San Francisco, CA - March 8, 2023**

The Internet Archive, a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving the web and making digital content accessible, has become the target of a significant hacktivist cyber attack.

The attack, which began on March 6, has targeted the Archive's Wayforward Machine, a tool that allows users to access archived versions of websites. Hackers have exploited a known vulnerability in the tool to gain access to user data, including IP addresses and search history.

In a statement released today, the Archive confirmed the attack and said it was working to address the vulnerability. The organization also urged users to change their passwords and be cautious of phishing emails.

"We take the security of our users' data very seriously," said Brewster Kahle, the Archive's founder and executive director. "We are working around the clock to resolve this issue and protect the privacy of our users."

The hacktivists responsible for the attack have not yet been identified. However, they are believed to be motivated by the Archive's support for Ukraine and its decision to archive Russian propaganda websites.

The attack on the Internet Archive is the latest in a series of cyber attacks targeting organizations that support Ukraine. In recent weeks, the Russian government has been accused of launching cyber attacks against the Ukrainian government, banks, and media outlets.

The Internet Archive is a critical resource for researchers, journalists, and historians. The organization's vast collection of websites and other digital content provides a unique and irreplaceable record of the web's history.

The attack on the Archive is a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity and the need to protect our digital infrastructure from malicious actors.

**About the Internet Archive**
