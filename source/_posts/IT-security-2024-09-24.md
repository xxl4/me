* Be wary of emails that seem too good to be true or pressure you to act immediately.

**8. Use a Password Manager:**
* Generate and manage strong, unique passwords for your email accounts to prevent spammers from gaining access.

**9. Educate Yourself:**
* Stay informed about the latest spam tactics and how to protect yourself.
* Share information with colleagues, family, and friends to increase awareness.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

**Passive Keyless Entry (PKE)**

PKE is a technology that allows a vehicle to be unlocked and started without the need for a physical key. It uses a small wireless transmitter (known as a key fob) that emits a low-frequency signal.

**How it Works:**

1. **Proximity Detection:** When the key fob is within a certain distance of the vehicle, it sends out a signal.
2. **Receiver Response:** The vehicle's receiver detects the signal and checks for a valid encryption key.
3. **Door Unlocking:** If the key is authorized, the vehicle's door locks engage and unlock.
4. **Engine Start:** Once inside the vehicle, the key fob must be placed in a specific location, such as a designated slot or dashboard mount. This allows the vehicle's immobilizer to deactivate and the engine to be started.

**Benefits of PKE:**

* **Convenience:** Eliminates the need to fumble with keys or worry about losing them.
* **Security:** Uses advanced encryption to prevent unauthorized entry or theft.
* **Accessibility:** Allows users to open the vehicle without removing heavy bags or items from their hands.
* **Enhanced Technology:** Can be integrated with other features such as remote start, trunk release, and vehicle location.

**Additional Features:**

* **Motion-Activated Locks:** Some PKE systems automatically unlock the vehicle when the user approaches and lock it when they move away.
* **Smart Locks:** Can be integrated with smartphones or smartwatches to enable keyless entry and start via touch or voice commands.
* **Anti-Jamming Technology:** Prevents thieves from blocking the key fob signal and gaining unauthorized access.

PKE is becoming increasingly common in modern vehicles, providing greater convenience, security, and accessibility.

* The evolving threat landscape, which includes new threats such as ransomware and phishing attacks

The report identifies four key trends that are expected to shape the cybersecurity workforce:

* **Increased demand for specialized skills:** Organizations are increasingly looking for cybersecurity professionals with specialized skills, such as threat intelligence, incident response, and cloud security.
* **Growing importance of training and certifications:** Cybersecurity professionals need to continuously update their skills and knowledge to keep up with the evolving threat landscape.
* **Diversity and inclusion in the cyber workforce:** The cybersecurity industry is working to increase diversity and inclusion in the workforce to ensure a broader range of perspectives and experiences.
* **Remote work and flexible working arrangements:** Cybersecurity professionals are increasingly working remotely and in flexible work arrangements, which can help organizations to attract and retain top talent.

The report recommends several strategies that organizations can use to address the cybersecurity workforce shortage:

* **Invest in training and development:** Organizations should invest in training and development programs to help their cybersecurity professionals develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed.
* **Promote diversity and inclusion:** Organizations should promote diversity and inclusion in the cybersecurity workforce to ensure a broader range of perspectives and experiences.
* **Support remote work and flexible working arrangements:** Organizations should support remote work and flexible working arrangements to attract and retain top cybersecurity talent.

The report concludes that the cybersecurity workforce shortage is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. By taking steps to invest in training and development, promote diversity and inclusion, and support remote work and flexible working arrangements, organizations can help to ensure that they have the cybersecurity professionals they need to protect their businesses.

**Five Key Questions for Kubernetes Disaster Recovery**

1. **Data Protection Strategy:** How will Kubernetes data, including pods, volumes, and configuration, be backed up and restored in the event of a disaster? Consider options like etcd backups, volume snapshots, and container image backups.

2. **Infrastructure Redundancy:** Is Kubernetes infrastructure redundant across multiple availability zones or regions? This ensures that workload deployment remains available even if a single zone or region experiences an outage.

3. **Application Resilience:** Are applications deployed in a resilient manner that can tolerate failures and recover gracefully? Consider techniques like load balancing, automatic failover, and health checks.

4. **Disaster Recovery Plan Testing:** How frequently is the disaster recovery plan tested to validate its effectiveness? Regular testing helps identify gaps and ensures the plan is up-to-date.

5. **Disaster Recovery Execution:** What is the process for executing the disaster recovery plan in the event of an actual disaster? This includes clear communication channels, responsibilities, and procedures for restoring infrastructure and applications.
