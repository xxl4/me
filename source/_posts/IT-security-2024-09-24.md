* Choose email providers with strong spam filters, such as Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo Mail.

**2. Enable Spam Filters:**

* Ensure your email account has spam filters enabled and set to a medium or high level.

**3. Mark Spam as Spam:**

* When you receive a spam email, mark it as spam. This helps your email provider identify and filter similar messages in the future.

**4. Unsubscribe from Unwanted Emails:**

* If you receive emails from companies you no longer wish to receive, unsubscribe from their mailing lists.

**5. Avoid Giving Out Your Email Address:**

* Be cautious about sharing your email address online. Only provide it to trusted sources and consider using a burner email address for unnecessary subscriptions.

**6. Use Disposable Email Addresses:**

* For online sign-ups or accounts you don't trust, consider using disposable email services that provide temporary or disposable email addresses.

**7. Use Anti-Spam Software:**

* Install anti-spam software on your computer or device to filter out spam before it reaches your inbox.

**8. Educate Yourself:**

* Learn how to identify spam emails. Common indicators include suspicious sender addresses, misleading subject lines, and urgent calls to action.

**9. Report Spam:**

* If you receive spam emails that violate your rights or contain harmful content, report them to your email provider and relevant authorities.

**10. Use Spam Blacklist Services:**

* Consider using spam blacklist services like Spamhaus and SpamCop, which provide lists of known spam domains and email addresses.

**Additional Tips:**

* Be skeptical of emails from unknown senders.
* Avoid clicking on links or attachments in suspicious emails.
* Keep your operating system and anti-spam software up to date.
* Educate your friends and family about spam and its dangers.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE) is a system that allows a driver to enter and start a vehicle without having to use a traditional key. Instead, the PKE system uses a key fob or card that emits a radio frequency (RF) signal. When the key fob or card is brought close to the vehicle, the RF signal is detected by an antenna in the vehicle, which then unlocks the doors and allows the driver to start the engine.

PKE systems are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer a number of advantages over traditional key systems. For example, PKE systems are more convenient, as drivers do not have to fumble with keys to enter or start their vehicles. PKE systems are also more secure, as they are difficult to hack or copy.

There are a few different types of PKE systems available. Some PKE systems only allow the driver to unlock and start the vehicle, while others also allow the driver to control other features, such as the climate control and audio system.

Here are some of the benefits of using a PKE system:

* Convenience: PKE systems are very convenient, as drivers do not have to fumble with keys to enter or start their vehicles.
* Security: PKE systems are more secure than traditional key systems, as they are difficult to hack or copy.
* Versatility: Some PKE systems allow drivers to control other features, such as the climate control and audio system.

Here are some of the drawbacks of using a PKE system:

* Cost: PKE systems can be more expensive than traditional key systems.
* Reliability: PKE systems can be less reliable than traditional key systems, as they are dependent on batteries.
* Vulnerability to hacking: PKE systems can be vulnerable to hacking, although this is a relatively rare occurrence.

Overall, PKE systems offer a number of advantages over traditional key systems. They are more convenient, secure, and versatile. However, they can be more expensive and less reliable than traditional key systems.

**Cyber Workforce Must Almost Double to Meet Global Talent Need**

The global cybersecurity workforce needs to grow by almost double to meet the increasing demand for skilled professionals, according to a new report by (ISC)². This shortage is driven by the rapid growth of the digital economy, which has led to an explosion in cyber threats.

The report, titled "Cybersecurity Workforce Study: Closing the Talent Gap," found that the global cybersecurity workforce needs to grow from 4.2 million professionals in 2022 to 7.5 million by 2027. This represents a growth of 79%, or nearly doubling the workforce.

The shortage is particularly acute in some regions, such as Asia-Pacific and Latin America. In Asia-Pacific, the workforce needs to grow by 115%, while in Latin America the growth need is 100%.

The report identifies several factors driving the demand for cybersecurity professionals, including:

* The growing number of cyberattacks
* The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks
* The adoption of new technologies, such as cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT)
* The increasing reliance on digital data

The shortage of cybersecurity professionals is having a significant impact on organizations, as they struggle to find and retain qualified staff. This is leading to increased cybersecurity risks, as organizations are unable to adequately protect their systems and data.

The report recommends several steps that can be taken to close the cybersecurity workforce gap, including:

* Increasing investment in cybersecurity education and training
* Promoting diversity and inclusion in the cybersecurity workforce
* Developing apprenticeship programs and other workforce development initiatives

"The cybersecurity workforce shortage is a global crisis," said Clar Rosso, CEO of (ISC)². "We need to take action now to close the gap and protect our critical infrastructure and data."
