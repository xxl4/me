## NCSC exposes Chinese company running malicious Mirai botnet
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366611295/NCSC-exposes-Chinese-company-running-malicious-Mirai-botnet)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 13:18:00 GMT

**NCSC Exposes Chinese Company Running Malicious Mirai Botnet**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has disclosed the identity of a Chinese company, Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology, as the operator of a botnet infected with the Mirai malware.

**What is Mirai Malware?**

Mirai is a type of malware that infects Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as routers, webcams, and security cameras. It then groups these infected devices into a botnet, which can be used for various malicious purposes such as launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

**Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology's Involvement**

The NCSC's investigation revealed that Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology was running a botnet of over 500,000 infected devices. These devices were being used to launch DDoS attacks against targeted organizations, disrupting their online services.

**Impact**

The botnet operated by Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology has been responsible for significant DDoS attacks in the past, including one that disrupted the websites of major banks and airlines in the United States in 2020.

**NCSC Actions**

In response to its findings, the NCSC has taken the following actions:

* Exposed the identity of Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology as the operator of the botnet.
* Shared intelligence with law enforcement and other cybersecurity agencies worldwide.
* Worked with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to mitigate the threat posed by the botnet.
* Provided guidance to organizations on how to protect themselves from Mirai malware and DDoS attacks.

**Significance**

The NCSC's disclosure is significant for several reasons:

* It demonstrates the growing threat posed by IoT malware and botnets.
* It highlights the importance of cybersecurity investigations and attribution.
* It shows that governments and cybersecurity agencies are actively combating malicious cyber activities.

**Recommendations for Organizations**

Organizations are advised to take the following steps to protect themselves from Mirai malware and DDoS attacks:

* Implement strong cybersecurity measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software.
* Keep all software and firmware up to date, especially on IoT devices.
* Secure IoT devices by changing default passwords and using strong security practices.
* Monitor networks for suspicious activity and respond quickly to any potential threats.

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/spam)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**What is Email Spam?**

Email spam is the unsolicited, bulk sending of unwanted electronic mail messages, typically advertising or promoting products or services. Spam emails are often characterized by:

* Irrelevant content or topics
* Generic or misleading subject lines
* Poor grammar and spelling
* Suspicious or malicious attachments

**How to Fight Email Spam:**

**1. Use Spam Filters:**

* Most email providers offer spam filters that automatically filter out suspected spam emails. Regularly check and adjust filter settings to improve performance.

**2. Be Cautious with Unknown Senders:**

* Avoid opening or clicking links in emails from unfamiliar senders. If you're unsure, hover over sender addresses or links to check their legitimacy.

**3. Use a Spam Cleaner App:**

* Third-party apps like SpamSieve or SpamAssassin scan incoming emails for spam and remove them before they reach your inbox.

**4. Report Spam Emails:**

* If you receive spam emails, report them to your email provider. This helps the provider improve its spam detection algorithms.

**5. Be Mindful of Personal Information:**

* Avoid sharing your email address on public forums or social media. Spammers often harvest email addresses from these sources.

**6. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN):**

* VPNs encrypt your internet traffic, making it harder for spammers to collect your email address.

**7. Delete Suspicious Attachments:**

* Never open attachments from unknown senders. If you're unsure, contact the sender directly to confirm its authenticity.

**8. Keep Software Up-to-Date:**

* Regularly update your email software and operating system. Updates often include security patches that help prevent spam.

**9. Use 2-Factor Authentication (2FA):**

* Enable 2FA on your email account to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access.

**10. Educate Family and Friends:**

* Inform friends and family about the dangers of spam and how to fight it. Encourage them to follow safe practices.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as keyless entry or keyless access, is a technology that allows a vehicle to be unlocked and started without the use of a physical key. Instead, the vehicle uses a key fob or other device that transmits a radio signal to the vehicle. When the key fob is in close proximity to the vehicle, the vehicle's door locks will unlock and the vehicle can be started by pressing a button.

PKE is a convenience feature that can make it easier to enter and start a vehicle, especially when carrying groceries or other items. It also can help to prevent theft, as it is more difficult for someone to steal a vehicle that does not have a physical key.

Here are some of the benefits of PKE:

* Convenience: PKE can make it easier to enter and start a vehicle, especially when carrying groceries or other items.
* Security: PKE can help to prevent theft, as it is more difficult for someone to steal a vehicle that does not have a physical key.
* Style: PKE can give a vehicle a more stylish and modern look.

If you are considering purchasing a new vehicle, you may want to consider one that has PKE. This technology can offer a number of benefits, including convenience, security, and style.

The cybersecurity industry is facing a severe talent shortage that requires the workforce to nearly double to meet the rising global demand. According to a recent report by Cybersecurity Ventures, the cybersecurity workforce gap is projected to reach 3.5 million unfilled positions by 2025.

The report highlights the urgent need for skilled cybersecurity professionals, as organizations become increasingly reliant on technology and face growing threats from cybercriminals. The demand for cybersecurity experts has surged due to factors such as:

* **Increased digitization:** The proliferation of connected devices and cloud-based systems has expanded the attack surface for cybercriminals.
* **Sophisticated cyberattacks:** Cybercriminals are employing more sophisticated tactics, making it essential for organizations to have skilled professionals to defend their systems.
* **Compliance regulations:** Governments and organizations are implementing stricter cybersecurity regulations, mandating the need for qualified cybersecurity personnel to ensure compliance.

The global talent gap is particularly evident in emerging markets, where the demand for cybersecurity professionals outstrips supply. The report notes that countries such as Brazil, India, and China are experiencing a significant shortage of skilled cybersecurity workers.

To address the workforce shortage, the report recommends several key strategies:

* **Increased education and training:** Governments and educational institutions need to invest in programs that train individuals in cybersecurity skills.
* **Upskilling and reskilling:** Organizations must provide opportunities for employees to upskill and reskill in cybersecurity to meet the evolving demands of the industry.
* **Diversity and inclusion:** The cybersecurity industry needs to promote diversity and inclusion to attract a wider range of talent.
* **International collaboration:** Countries and organizations should collaborate to share best practices and resources to develop a global cybersecurity workforce.

The critical need for cybersecurity professionals underscores the importance of investing in education, training, and workforce development. By taking proactive measures to address the talent gap, organizations and governments can strengthen their cybersecurity defenses and protect their digital assets from evolving threats.
