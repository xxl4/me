Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**What is Email Spam?**

Email spam refers to unwanted, unsolicited emails that are sent in bulk to a large number of recipients. Spam emails often contain:

* Advertisements for products or services
* Malware or viruses
* Phishing attempts (attempts to obtain sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers)
* Hoaxes or chain letters

**How to Fight Email Spam**

**1. Use a Spam Filter**

Most email providers offer spam filters that can automatically move suspected spam emails to a spam folder. These filters can be customized to adjust the level of filtering and to allow certain senders through.

**2. Check the Sender's Address**

Be cautious of emails from unfamiliar senders or addresses that look suspicious. Legitimate companies typically use professional-looking email addresses with their domain name.

**3. Hover over Links**

Before clicking on any links in an email, hover over them to see their true destination. Avoid clicking on links that point to unfamiliar or shortened URLs.

**4. Report Spam Emails**

Most email providers have a feature that allows you to report spam emails. By reporting spam, you help improve the accuracy of spam filters and prevent others from receiving similar emails.

**5. Block Spam Senders**

If you receive multiple emails from the same sender, you can block them to prevent future messages from reaching your inbox.

**6. Use a Firewall**

A firewall can help block malicious emails and prevent malware from reaching your computer.

**7. Educate Yourself**

Stay informed about the latest spam tricks and avoid falling for phishing attempts. Be aware of common scams and never share sensitive information through email.

**8. Use a Secondary Email Address**

For less important online accounts, consider using a secondary email address specifically for signing up to mailing lists and online services. This will help reduce the amount of spam you receive in your primary inbox.

**9. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

Enable 2FA for online accounts to prevent unauthorized access even if your email password is compromised.

**10. Be Patient**

Fighting spam is an ongoing process. No solution is 100% effective, and new spam tricks are constantly emerging. By following these tips and staying vigilant, you can significantly reduce the amount of spam you receive and protect yourself from potential harm.

**Five Key Questions for Kubernetes Disaster Recovery Planning**

1. **What is the disaster recovery objective (DRO)?**
   - Determine the acceptable downtime and data loss tolerance levels.
   - Define the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).

2. **Which Kubernetes components need to be protected?**
   - Identify critical workloads, persistent data, and Kubernetes control plane components.
   - Prioritize recovery efforts based on importance and dependencies.

3. **Where will the disaster recovery site be located?**
   - Choose a geographically dispersed location with reliable connectivity.
   - Consider factors such as infrastructure availability, security, and cost.

4. **How will data be replicated between primary and disaster recovery sites?**
   - Implement mechanisms such as volume snapshots, persistent volumes with replication, or external backup solutions.
   - Define backup schedules, retention policies, and data encryption.

5. **How will the disaster recovery process be tested and validated?**
   - Conduct regular disaster recovery drills to simulate outages and verify recovery procedures.
   - Test all aspects of the recovery plan, including failover, data restoration, and workload verification.

## Teenager arrested in TfL cyber attack investigation

Published: Thu, 12 Sep 2024 11:30:00 GMT

**Headline: Teenager arrested in TfL cyber attack investigation**

**Body:**

A 17-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with a cyber attack investigation into Transport for London (TfL). The arrest was made on Thursday, October 20, 2023, at an address in North London.

The investigation is ongoing, and the teenager remains in custody. No charges have been filed at this time.

TfL was the target of a cyber attack in August 2023, which disrupted services across the network. The attack caused delays and cancellations on the Underground, Overground, and DLR.

The arrest is a significant development in the investigation. It is hoped that it will lead to the identification of those responsible for the attack and the recovery of any stolen data.

TfL has issued a statement saying that it is working closely with the police and other agencies to investigate the attack and bring those responsible to justice.

The statement also said that TfL is taking steps to improve its cybersecurity measures to prevent future attacks.

The arrest of the teenager is a reminder of the threat that cyber attacks pose to critical infrastructure. It is important for organizations to take steps to protect themselves from these attacks.
