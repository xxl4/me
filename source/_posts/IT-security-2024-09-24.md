The report, which was commissioned by IBM Security, found that there will be 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs globally by 2025. This represents a significant increase from the 1.8 million unfilled jobs in 2019.

The report attributes the growing demand for cybersecurity professionals to a number of factors, including the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, the growing adoption of cloud computing and mobile devices, and the increasing amount of data being collected and stored by organizations.

"The cybersecurity workforce is facing a perfect storm of challenges," said Steve Morgan, founder and CEO of Cybersecurity Ventures. "The number of cyberattacks is rising, the sophistication of attacks is increasing, and the volume of data being collected and stored is growing exponentially. This is creating a huge demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals."

The report found that the United States has the largest cybersecurity workforce in the world, with over 1 million workers. However, the report also found that the United States is facing a shortage of cybersecurity professionals, with over 500,000 unfilled jobs in 2019.

Other countries with large cybersecurity workforces include China, India, the United Kingdom, and Germany. However, these countries are also facing shortages of cybersecurity professionals.

The report recommends a number of steps that organizations can take to address the cybersecurity workforce shortage, including:

* Investing in cybersecurity education and training programs
* Offering competitive salaries and benefits to attract and retain cybersecurity professionals
* Creating a more inclusive cybersecurity workforce
* Partnering with educational institutions to develop cybersecurity programs

"The cybersecurity workforce shortage is a serious problem that is only going to get worse in the years to come," said Morgan. "Organizations need to take steps now to address this shortage, or they will face significant risks to their data and systems."
