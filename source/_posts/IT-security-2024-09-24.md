[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366611295/NCSC-exposes-Chinese-company-running-malicious-Mirai-botnet)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 13:18:00 GMT

**The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has exposed a Chinese company as the operator of a malicious botnet that has been used to launch attacks against targets worldwide.**

The botnet, known as Mirai, is a type of malware that infects internet-connected devices such as routers, webcams, and DVRs. Once infected, these devices can be controlled remotely by the botnet operator, who can use them to launch DDoS attacks, steal data, or spread other malware.

The NCSC said that the company responsible for operating the Mirai botnet is called Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology. Xiongmai is a Chinese company that manufactures and sells a range of internet-connected devices, including surveillance cameras, IP cameras, and network video recorders.

The NCSC said that it had been tracking Xiongmai's activities for several months and had identified the company as the operator of the Mirai botnet. The NCSC said that Xiongmai had been using the botnet to launch DDoS attacks against targets in the UK and other countries.

The NCSC said that it had shared its findings with law enforcement agencies in the UK and other countries. The NCSC said that it was working with these agencies to disrupt the Mirai botnet and to hold Xiongmai accountable for its actions.

The NCSC said that the exposure of Xiongmai was a significant development in the fight against cybercrime. The NCSC said that it was committed to working with law enforcement agencies to disrupt malicious botnets and to hold those responsible for operating them accountable.

**The NCSC has also issued a warning to UK businesses and organizations about the Mirai botnet. The NCSC said that businesses and organizations should take steps to protect their devices from infection by Mirai and other types of malware.**

The NCSC said that businesses and organizations should:

* Keep their devices up to date with the latest security patches.
* Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication.
* Use a firewall to block unauthorized access to their networks.
* Monitor their networks for suspicious activity.

The NCSC said that businesses and organizations should also be aware of the signs of a DDoS attack. The NCSC said that businesses and organizations should contact their internet service provider immediately if they suspect that they are under attack.

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**What is Email Spam?**

Email spam refers to unsolicited, bulk electronic messages sent to a large number of recipients. It is typically used for advertising, phishing, or spreading malware.

**Common Types of Email Spam:**

* **Bulk advertising:** Promoting products or services without the recipient's consent.
* **Phishing:** Fraudulent emails that appear to come from legitimate sources to trick recipients into sharing personal information.
* **Malware distribution:** Emails containing malicious attachments or links that can infect devices with viruses or other malware.
* **Nigerian Prince scam:** Advance fee frauds that lure victims with promises of large sums of money.

**How to Fight Email Spam:**

**1. Use a Spam Filter:**

* Enable spam filters in your email client or use a dedicated spam filtering service.
* Regularly update the spam filter rules to keep up with evolving spam techniques.

**2. Check Sender Addresses:**

* Be cautious of emails from unknown senders.
* Hover over links and sender addresses to verify authenticity before clicking.

**3. Avoid Sharing Personal Information:**

* Never share personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or social security numbers, via email.
* Legitimate companies will not request such information via unsolicited emails.

**4. Report Spam:**

* Report spam emails to your email provider or to organizations like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
* This helps identify spammers and improve filtering systems.

**5. Unsubscribe from Unwanted Lists:**

* Find the "unsubscribe" link in unwanted commercial emails.
* Keep in mind that some spammers create fake unsubscribe links to harvest email addresses.

**6. Use a Disposable Email Address:**

* Create a separate email address for online registrations or subscriptions that may generate spam.
* This helps reduce the amount of spam reaching your primary inbox.

**7. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN):**

* A VPN masks your IP address, making it harder for spammers to collect your email address.

**8. Educate Yourself:**

* Stay informed about the latest spam tactics and how to protect yourself.
* Share your knowledge with others to raise awareness about spam.

**9. File a Complaint:**

* If you suspect illegal spam activities, you can file a complaint with the FTC or the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).

**10. Be Vigilant:**

* Spam techniques are constantly evolving. Stay vigilant and be suspicious of any suspicious emails you receive.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) is a technology that allows a vehicle to be locked and unlocked without the use of a physical key. It uses a small, electronic device that emits a low-frequency signal that is detected by a receiver in the vehicle. When the signal is received, the vehicle's doors will unlock and the ignition will be activated.

PKE is a convenient technology that can make it easier to enter and exit your vehicle. It is also more secure than traditional keys, as it is much more difficult to duplicate or steal a PKE device.

PKE systems typically consist of two main components: a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter is usually located in the keychain or fob, and the receiver is located in the vehicle. When the transmitter is pressed, it sends a signal to the receiver, which then unlocks the doors and disarms the security system.

PKE systems are becoming increasingly popular on new vehicles, and they are expected to become even more common in the future.

**Cyber Workforce Must Almost Double to Meet Global Talent Need**

The global cyber workforce must grow by nearly 100% over the next decade to meet the soaring demand for cybersecurity professionals, according to a new report from (ISC)².

The report, "The Cybersecurity Workforce Gap: An International Perspective," found that the global cyber workforce currently stands at 4.2 million people, but will need to grow to 8.4 million by 2030 to meet the evolving threatscape.

The report also found that the cyber workforce gap is most severe in developing countries, where the shortage of skilled professionals is particularly acute. In Africa, for example, there are only 0.1 cybersecurity professionals for every 10,000 people, compared to 0.7 professionals per 10,000 people in North America.

The shortage of cybersecurity professionals is driven by a number of factors, including:

* The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks
* The growing number of connected devices
* The increasing adoption of cloud computing
* The lack of qualified candidates

To address the cyber workforce gap, the report recommends a number of strategies, including:

* Increasing investment in cybersecurity education and training
* Promoting diversity and inclusion in the cybersecurity workforce
* Encouraging lifelong learning for cybersecurity professionals
* Developing public-private partnerships to support cybersecurity workforce development

"The cyber workforce gap is a global problem that requires a global solution," said Clar Rosso, CEO of (ISC)². "We need to work together to address this issue and ensure that we have the skilled workforce we need to protect our digital world."

The report's findings are a wake-up call for governments, businesses, and educators around the world. We need to invest in cybersecurity workforce development now to ensure that we are prepared for the cyber threats of the future.
