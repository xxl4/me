**CrowdStrike Incident Shows the Need to Rethink Cyber**

The recent CrowdStrike incident highlights the urgent need to rethink how we approach cybersecurity. The incident, which involved a sophisticated attack on CrowdStrike's own infrastructure, underscores the evolving nature of cyber threats and the need for a more proactive and adaptable approach to defense.

**Evolving Cyber Threats**

The CrowdStrike incident demonstrates that cyber threats are becoming increasingly complex and sophisticated. The attackers behind the incident used a combination of malware, phishing, and social engineering techniques to gain access to CrowdStrike's systems and steal sensitive data. Traditional security measures, such as firewalls and antivirus software, were unable to detect and prevent the attack.

**Need for Proactive Defense**

The incident also highlights the importance of proactive defense strategies. Rather than relying solely on reactive measures that respond to attacks after they have occurred, organizations must adopt a proactive approach that focuses on preventing attacks from happening in the first place. This includes investing in threat intelligence, vulnerability management, and incident response planning.

**Importance of Collaboration and Information Sharing**

The CrowdStrike incident also underscores the importance of collaboration and information sharing among organizations in the cybersecurity space. The incident was first detected by security researchers from another company, who alerted CrowdStrike to the potential breach. This collaborative effort allowed CrowdStrike to respond quickly and mitigate the damage caused by the attack.

**Rethinking Cybersecurity**

In light of the evolving cyber landscape, it is clear that we need to rethink our approach to cybersecurity. We must:

* **Embrace a proactive defense posture:** Focus on preventing attacks rather than simply reacting to them.
* **Invest in threat intelligence:** Gather and analyze data on emerging threats to stay ahead of attackers.
* **Implement multi-layered security:** Deploy a combination of security technologies and best practices to protect against a wide range of threats.
* **Foster collaboration and information sharing:** Share knowledge and best practices with other organizations to create a more robust defense against cyber threats.

**Conclusion**

The CrowdStrike incident is a wake-up call that we cannot afford to be complacent in the face of evolving cyber threats. We must rethink our cybersecurity strategies and adopt a more proactive, collaborative, and adaptable approach to defense. By taking these steps, we can better protect our critical systems, data, and infrastructure from the increasing sophistication of cyber attackers.

* Use strong and unique passwords for your email account to prevent unauthorized access by spammers.

**10. Educate Others:**

* Share information about email spam with friends, family, and colleagues to raise awareness and help reduce the spread of unwanted messages.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE) is a keyless entry system that allows a user to enter a vehicle without actively operating a key. It is also known as keyless access or keyless go. PKE systems use a combination of sensors and wireless technology to detect the presence of a key within a certain range of the vehicle. When the key is detected, the system unlocks the doors and allows the user to enter and start the vehicle without having to physically insert the key into the ignition.

PKE systems are typically more convenient than traditional key-operated entry systems, as they allow users to enter their vehicle without having to fumble with keys. They are also more secure, as they eliminate the risk of lost or stolen keys. PKE systems are becoming increasingly common on new vehicles, and are expected to become standard on all vehicles in the near future.

**Cyber Workforce Almost Double to Meet Global Talent Need**

The global cybersecurity workforce needs to almost double by 2025 to keep pace with the increasing threat of cybercrime, according to a recent report. The study, conducted by Cybersecurity Ventures, predicts that the global cybersecurity workforce will grow from 4.19 million workers to 7.66 million workers by 2025.

The report highlights several factors contributing to the growing need for cybersecurity professionals, including:

**Increased sophistication of cyberattacks:** Cybercriminals are employing increasingly sophisticated techniques to breach systems and compromise data. These attacks require specialized knowledge and skills to detect, prevent, and remediate.

**Expanding use of technology:** The rapid adoption of new technologies, such as cloud computing and IoT devices, has created a larger attack surface for cybercriminals to exploit.

**Growing awareness of cybersecurity risks:** Organizations and individuals are becoming more aware of the potential impacts of cybercrime, leading to increased demand for cybersecurity services.

The shortage of qualified cybersecurity professionals poses significant challenges for organizations. Unfilled positions leave organizations vulnerable to cyberattacks, as they lack the manpower to monitor and protect their systems effectively.

To address the talent shortage, the cybersecurity industry must prioritize initiatives to attract, train, and retain skilled workers. These initiatives include:

**Education and training:** Educational institutions and training providers need to develop programs that equip individuals with the necessary cybersecurity knowledge and skills.

**Diversity and inclusion:** The cybersecurity industry needs to promote diversity and inclusion to attract a broader pool of candidates. This includes initiatives that encourage more women, minorities, and veterans to enter the field.

**Collaboration and partnerships:** Industry leaders, government agencies, and educational institutions need to collaborate to create effective workforce development programs.

The cybersecurity workforce shortage is a global problem that requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders. By investing in education and training, promoting diversity, and encouraging collaboration, the industry can help to close the talent gap and protect organizations from the evolving threat of cybercrime.
