## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE) is a keyless car entry system that allows a vehicle to be unlocked and started without the need for a traditional key. PKE systems use a key fob that emits a low-frequency RF signal. When the key fob is in close proximity to the vehicle, the door locks will unlock and the engine will start. PKE systems are more convenient and secure than traditional key systems, as they eliminate the need for a physical key and make it more difficult to steal a vehicle.

Published: Thu, 12 Sep 2024 11:30:00 GMT

**Teenager Arrested in TfL Cyber Attack Investigation**

A 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of cyber attacks against Transport for London (TfL), which led to disruptions in Tube and bus services over the weekend.

The National Crime Agency's (NCA) National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) conducted the arrest in St Albans, Hertfordshire, on Monday. The boy has been taken into custody for questioning.

The investigation relates to a series of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on TfL's IT systems on Saturday and Sunday. These attacks flooded TfL's servers with a high volume of traffic, causing significant disruption to operations.

TfL services, including the Tube and buses, were severely affected, with delays, cancellations, and technical issues reported throughout the network. Passengers faced long queues and extended travel times.

The NCCU, which investigates major cyber attacks in the UK, is now leading the investigation into the incident. It is working closely with TfL, the Metropolitan Police, and other law enforcement agencies.

A spokesperson for the NCA said: "The arrest of a teenager in connection with this investigation shows that we take cyber attacks against critical national infrastructure very seriously. We will use all available resources to identify and prosecute those responsible."

TfL has condemned the attacks and thanked the NCA for its swift response. The organization has confirmed that all affected systems have been restored and services are now running normally.

However, TfL has also warned that some residual delays and cancellations may still occur as the network returns to full operation.

The arrest of a teenager in this case serves as a reminder that cyber attacks are not just a threat to businesses but also to essential services and the public at large. It highlights the need for continued vigilance and collaboration between law enforcement agencies, businesses, and citizens to combat and prevent such malicious activities.

## European enterprise networking lacks hybrid maturity
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366610425/European-enterprise-networking-lacks-hybrid-maturity)

Published: Thu, 12 Sep 2024 07:28:00 GMT

**European Enterprise Networking Lacks Hybrid Maturity**

Despite the increasing adoption of hybrid cloud environments, European enterprises are lagging in hybrid network maturity, according to a recent study. The study, conducted by Equinix and IDC, found that only 4% of European enterprises have a fully mature hybrid network strategy, while 68% are still in the early stages of development.

There are several factors contributing to this lack of maturity, including:

* **Complexity:** Hybrid networks are complex to design and manage, as they require a deep understanding of both on-premises and cloud infrastructure.
* **Cost:** Building and maintaining a hybrid network can be expensive, as it requires investment in both hardware and software.
* **Security:** Connecting on-premises networks to the cloud introduces new security risks that need to be addressed.
* **Skills shortage:** There is a shortage of qualified IT professionals with the skills necessary to design and manage hybrid networks.

As a result of these challenges, many European enterprises are struggling to reap the full benefits of hybrid cloud environments. These benefits include increased agility, scalability, and cost efficiency.

To address this lack of maturity, European enterprises need to take the following steps:

* **Develop a clear hybrid network strategy:** This strategy should outline the business goals that the hybrid network will support, as well as the technical requirements and constraints.
* **Invest in the right infrastructure:** The infrastructure for a hybrid network should be designed to support the specific needs of the business. This includes choosing the right hardware, software, and cloud services.
* **Implement a strong security strategy:** The security strategy for a hybrid network should address the risks associated with connecting on-premises networks to the cloud. This includes implementing security controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access control lists.
* **Train IT staff:** IT staff need to be trained on the skills necessary to design and manage hybrid networks. This includes training on cloud technologies, networking protocols, and security best practices.

By taking these steps, European enterprises can improve the maturity of their hybrid networks and reap the full benefits of hybrid cloud environments.

**Benefits of Hybrid Network Maturity**

There are several benefits to achieving hybrid network maturity, including:

* **Increased agility:** Hybrid networks allow enterprises to move applications and data between on-premises and cloud environments quickly and easily. This agility can help enterprises respond to changing business needs and market conditions.
* **Improved scalability:** Hybrid networks can be scaled up or down to meet the changing needs of the business. This scalability can help enterprises avoid overprovisioning or underprovisioning their infrastructure.
* **Reduced costs:** Hybrid networks can help enterprises reduce costs by optimizing the use of on-premises and cloud resources. This cost savings can be reinvested in other areas of the business.
* **Improved security:** Hybrid networks can help enterprises improve security by isolating sensitive data and applications from the public internet. This isolation can help protect against data breaches and other security threats.

**Conclusion**

European enterprises are lagging in hybrid network maturity, which is hindering their ability to reap the full benefits of hybrid cloud environments. By taking the steps outlined above, enterprises can improve the maturity of their hybrid networks and gain a competitive advantage in the digital economy.
