[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) is an advanced automotive technology that allows drivers to lock, unlock, and start their vehicles without using a traditional key. It uses radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to communicate between the vehicle and a key fob or smartphone.

Here's how PKE works:

1. **Unlocking:** When the driver approaches the vehicle with the key fob or smartphone in their pocket or purse, the RFID chip inside the device sends a signal to the vehicle's antenna.

2. **Verification:** The vehicle's control unit verifies the signal and checks if the device is authorized to access the vehicle.

3. **Unlocking Doors:** If the device is authorized, the control unit sends a command to unlock the vehicle's doors. This can be done automatically as the driver gets close or by pressing a button on the door handle.

4. **Starting the Engine:** Once the doors are unlocked, the driver can enter the vehicle and start the engine without inserting a key. The key fob or smartphone typically has a "start" button that sends a secure signal to the vehicle's ignition system.

5. **Locking:** When the driver exits the vehicle and moves away, the system detects the absence of the authorized device and automatically locks the doors.

PKE offers several advantages over traditional key-based entry systems:

* **Convenience:** No need to fumble with keys or search for them in pockets or bags.
* **Hands-free operation:** Doors unlock and the engine starts while the key fob or smartphone remains in the driver's pocket or purse.
* **Enhanced security:** RFID signals are encrypted and difficult to intercept or duplicate, making it harder for unauthorized individuals to access the vehicle.
* **Comfort:** Even on cold or rainy days, drivers can simply approach their vehicle and enter without having to expose keys to the elements.
* **Smart functionality:** Some PKE systems can also be integrated with remote start, smartphone apps, and other connected car features.

**Teenager arrested in TfL cyber attack investigation**

A teenager has been arrested in connection with a cyber attack on Transport for London (TfL) that caused disruption to Tube and DLR services last weekend.

The 16-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of hacking and causing a public nuisance. He has been bailed until a date in August.

The attack, which took place on Saturday, July 18, caused delays and cancellations on several Tube lines and the DLR. TfL said the attack was "unprecedented" and had "a significant impact" on its services.

The Metropolitan Police is investigating the attack and has not ruled out further arrests.

TfL has said that it is working to improve its security in the wake of the attack.

The arrest comes after TfL announced that it would be investing £10 million in its cyber security over the next five years.

TfL's chief information security officer, Stuart Harvey, said: "We are committed to protecting our customers and our network from cyber attacks. We have invested heavily in our security and we are constantly working to improve our defenses."

The cyber attack on TfL is the latest in a series of high-profile cyber attacks on UK businesses and organizations.

In May, the National Health Service (NHS) was hit by a global ransomware attack that caused widespread disruption to its services.

The government has said that it is committed to improving the UK's cyber security and has announced a number of measures to do this.

These measures include:

* Investing in the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)
* Developing a new National Cyber Security Strategy
* Working with businesses and organizations to improve their cyber security

The government has also said that it is considering new laws to tackle cyber crime.
