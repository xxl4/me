## HSBC tests post-quantum VPN tunnel for digital ledgers
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366611375/HSBC-tests-post-quantum-VPN-tunnel-for-digital-ledgers)

Published: Thu, 19 Sep 2024 10:31:00 GMT

**HSBC Tests Post-Quantum VPN Tunnel for Digital Ledgers**

HSBC, a global banking and financial services company, is exploring the use of post-quantum cryptography to secure digital ledgers. The bank has successfully tested a post-quantum virtual private network (VPN) tunnel between two geographically dispersed data centers, demonstrating the potential of this technology to protect sensitive data in the face of emerging quantum computing threats.

**Quantum Computing and Cryptographic Risks**

Quantum computing is a rapidly developing field that has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of technology, including cryptography. Traditional encryption algorithms, such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers or solving discrete logarithm problems. However, quantum computers could potentially break these algorithms in polynomial time, rendering current cryptographic protections obsolete.

**Post-Quantum Cryptography**

Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) refers to cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to attacks by quantum computers. These algorithms are based on different mathematical problems that are believed to be difficult to solve, even with the increased computational power of quantum computers.

**HSBC's Post-Quantum VPN Tunnel**

HSBC's post-quantum VPN tunnel uses a PQC algorithm called NTRUEncrypt to establish a secure connection between two remote data centers. NTRUEncrypt is a lattice-based encryption algorithm that is considered to be quantum-resistant. The VPN tunnel is used to transmit sensitive data, such as financial transactions and customer information, between the two data centers.

**Implications for Digital Ledgers**

The successful testing of the post-quantum VPN tunnel has implications for the security of digital ledgers, such as blockchain networks. Digital ledgers rely on cryptography to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data. The emergence of quantum computing poses a significant threat to these networks, as it could allow attackers to break the encryption and access sensitive information.

By incorporating PQC algorithms into digital ledger systems, banks and other financial institutions can mitigate the risks posed by quantum computing. This will help to ensure the security and resilience of these systems in the face of future technological advancements.

**Conclusion**

HSBC's successful testing of a post-quantum VPN tunnel demonstrates the bank's commitment to exploring innovative technologies to enhance the security of its digital systems. The use of PQC algorithms in digital ledgers can help to protect sensitive data from emerging quantum computing threats, ensuring the continued resilience and integrity of these systems in the digital age.

* SBLs are databases that contain lists of known spammers.
* Email servers can use SBLs to block emails from suspicious senders.

**3. Check Email Headers:**

* Spam emails often have suspicious headers, such as a fake sender email address or a forged "from" field.
* Examine the headers of suspected emails before opening them.

**4. Avoid Opening Suspicious Links:**

* Spam emails may contain links to phishing websites or malware downloads.
* Hover over links to check the actual destination before clicking.

**5. Use a VPN or Disposable Email Address:**

* Using a VPN or disposable email address when signing up for online services can help reduce the risk of receiving spam.

**6. Mark Emails as Spam:**

* Report spam emails to your email provider using the "Mark as Spam" button.
* This helps the spam filter learn and improve its accuracy.

**7. Use Spam-Proofing Software:**

* There are dedicated software solutions available to detect and block spam.
* These programs can integrate with email clients and provide additional protection.

**8. Educate Yourself:**

* Stay informed about the latest spam tactics and trends.

**9. Check Your Personal Information:**

* Spammers may obtain your email address from public records or data breaches.
* Review your online accounts and remove any unnecessary personal information that may be exposed.

**10. Report Spam to Authorities:**

* If you believe you have received spam, report it to the appropriate authorities, such as the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) or your local law enforcement agency.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as keyless entry or smart entry, is a feature that allows a vehicle to be unlocked and started without using a physical key. Instead, the car's computer detects the presence of a key fob or other authorized device, and unlocks the doors and allows the engine to be started when the authorized device is present.

PKE systems typically use a radio frequency (RF) signal to communicate between the key fob and the car's computer. The key fob transmits a coded signal to the car, which is then verified by the computer. If the code matches, the car will unlock and allow the engine to be started.

PKE systems are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer a number of advantages over traditional key-based entry systems. These advantages include:

* Convenience: PKE systems eliminate the need to fumble for keys, which can be especially helpful in situations where you have your hands full.
* Security: PKE systems are more secure than traditional key-based entry systems, as they make it more difficult for thieves to steal your car. This is because thieves cannot simply break a window and hot-wire the car; they need to have the authorized device in order to unlock and start the car.
* Convenience: PKE systems can also be integrated with other features, such as remote start and trunk release. This can make it even easier to use your car.

If you are looking for a more convenient, secure, and user-friendly way to enter and start your car, then PKE is a great option.

## Kubernetes disaster recovery: Five key questions
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Kubernetes-disaster-recovery-Five-key-questions)

Published: Thu, 12 Sep 2024 11:57:00 GMT

1. **What is your Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO)?**

Your RPO is the maximum amount of data you can afford to lose in a disaster. Your RTO is the maximum amount of time your systems can be down before they start to impact your business. These two factors will determine the type of disaster recovery plan you need.

2. **What are your disaster recovery options?**

There are a number of different disaster recovery options available, including:

* **Hot site:** A fully redundant data center that is ready to take over operations in the event of a disaster. This is the most expensive option, but it also provides the highest level of protection.
* **Warm site:** A data center that is not fully redundant, but can be brought online quickly in the event of a disaster. This is a less expensive option than a hot site, but it also provides less protection.
* **Cold site:** A data center that is not equipped with any hardware or software. In the event of a disaster, you would need to bring in your own hardware and software to get the site up and running. This is the least expensive option, but it also provides the least protection.
* **Cloud-based disaster recovery:** A disaster recovery solution that uses the cloud to provide backup and recovery services. This option can be more cost-effective than traditional disaster recovery solutions, and it also provides the flexibility to scale your recovery solution as needed.

3. **How will you test your disaster recovery plan?**

It is important to test your disaster recovery plan regularly to ensure that it works as expected. You should test your plan under a variety of conditions, including:

* **Full-scale disaster:** A complete loss of your primary data center.
* **Partial disaster:** A loss of a single server or application.
* **Network failure:** A loss of connectivity to your primary data center.

4. **How will you communicate with your team and customers during a disaster?**

In the event of a disaster, it is important to be able to communicate with your team and customers. You should develop a communication plan that includes:

* **Contact information for key team members.**
* **A list of communication channels that you will use.**
* **A plan for how you will communicate with customers.**

5. **How will you pay for disaster recovery?**

Disaster recovery can be expensive. You should factor the cost of disaster recovery into your budget. You may also want to consider purchasing disaster recovery insurance.
