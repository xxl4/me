**Teenager Arrested in TfL Cyber Attack Investigation**

London's Metropolitan Police have arrested a teenager in connection with the recent cyber attack on Transport for London (TfL).

The 16-year-old boy was detained at his home address in Oxfordshire on suspicion of computer misuse and blackmail. He remains in custody.

The cyber attack, which occurred on January 10, disrupted TfL's payment systems and caused significant delays across the network. Services were severely affected, with many Tube and bus lines experiencing cancellations and reduced frequencies.

Investigators believe that the attack involved the use of ransomware, a type of malware that encrypts data and demands a ransom payment in exchange for its release. TfL has stated that it did not pay any ransom.

The arrest is the first to be made in connection with the incident. Detectives from the Met's Cyber Crime Unit are continuing to investigate the attack and identify those responsible.

TfL has confirmed that it is working closely with the police and is taking steps to strengthen its cybersecurity measures. The company said that it is "committed to keeping the transport network safe and secure for everyone."

The cyber attack on TfL is a reminder of the growing threat of online criminality. Experts have urged organizations to invest in robust cybersecurity measures and to be prepared to respond to potential attacks.
