[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366611295/NCSC-exposes-Chinese-company-running-malicious-Mirai-botnet)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 13:18:00 GMT

**NCSC Exposes Chinese Company Running Malicious Mirai Botnet**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a part of the UK's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), has revealed a Chinese company called Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd. (Qihoo 360) is operating a malicious botnet called Mirai.

**What is Mirai?**

Mirai is a type of malware that targets Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as routers and webcams, infecting them and turning them into bots. These bots are then used to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which can disrupt online services by flooding them with traffic.

**Qihoo 360's Involvement**

NCSC's investigation found that Qihoo 360 has been operating Mirai since at least 2018. The company has been using the botnet to target and disrupt foreign networks, including those in the US and Europe.

**Impact**

Mirai has been responsible for numerous high-profile DDoS attacks, including those against the websites of Twitter, Amazon, and PayPal. The attacks have caused significant disruption and financial losses for the affected companies.

**NCSC's Actions**

NCSC has attributed the Mirai attacks to Qihoo 360 and has shared its findings with the Chinese government. The organization has also issued a warning to UK organizations about the threat posed by the botnet and has advised them to take steps to protect their systems.

**Government Response**

The UK government has condemned Qihoo 360's actions, stating that they are "illegal and harmful." The Foreign Office has summoned the Chinese ambassador to express its concerns and has urged China to take action against the company.

**Conclusion**

NCSC's exposure of Qihoo 360's involvement in the Mirai botnet has highlighted the threat posed by state-sponsored cyberattacks and the need for international cooperation in combating online crime.

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/spam)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**What is Email Spam?**

Email spam refers to unsolicited, bulk electronic messages sent to large numbers of email addresses. These messages are typically sent by automated programs known as "bots" or "spambots."

**Characteristics of Spam Emails:**

* **Unrequested and unsolicited:** Spam emails are not wanted by the recipient and are sent without their consent.
* **Bulk in nature:** Spammers send messages to a large number of addresses in a short period.
* **Commercial or malicious content:** Spam emails often contain advertisements, phishing attempts, or malware.
* **Misleading subject lines:** They often use deceptive or sensational subject lines to trick recipients into opening them.

**Fighting Email Spam**

**1. Use Spam Filters:**

* Enable spam filters in your email client or online email service. These filters automatically identify and redirect spam messages to a designated folder.

**2. Be Cautious of Phishing Links:**

* Never click on links or attachments in unsolicited emails. Phishing emails often contain links that lead to malicious websites designed to steal sensitive information.

**3. Report Spam Emails:**

* Mark spam emails as "spam" in your email client or report them to the relevant authorities. This helps improve the effectiveness of spam filters.

**4. Create Strong Passwords:**

* Use strong passwords that are difficult to guess and avoid using the same password for multiple accounts. Weak passwords can make your email account vulnerable to spammers.

**5. Use Email Privacy Services:**

* Consider using email privacy services that offer encrypted and protected communication channels. These services can help prevent spammers from accessing your email address.

**6. Block Spammers:**

* Add known spammers to your blocked list in your email client. This will prevent them from sending you future emails.

**7. Limit Sharing Your Email Address:**

* Be cautious about sharing your email address publicly on social media, forums, or websites. Spammers often harvest email addresses from such sources.

**8. Use Anti-Malware Software:**

* Install and keep anti-malware software on your computer to detect and remove any malicious programs that may have infiltrated your system through spam emails.

**9. Educate Yourself and Others:**

* Stay informed about the latest spam techniques and educate others on the dangers of spam. By raising awareness, you can help reduce the spread of spam.

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) is a system that allows a vehicle to be unlocked and started without the need to physically insert a key into the lock or ignition. Instead, a small fob or key card is carried by the user and communicates with the vehicle's computer system via radio waves. When the fob is in close proximity to the vehicle, the computer system detects its presence and unlocks the doors and allows the engine to be started without the need for a key. PKE systems are becoming increasingly common on new vehicles and offer a number of advantages over traditional key-based systems, such as increased convenience and security.
