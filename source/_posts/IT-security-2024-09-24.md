## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as proximity keyless entry, is a system that allows a person to lock and unlock a vehicle without taking out a traditional key. Instead, the vehicle is unlocked when the person is in close proximity to it, and the doors are locked when the person walks away.

PKE systems typically use a small, battery-powered transmitter that is carried by the person. The transmitter emits a radio signal that is picked up by a receiver in the vehicle. When the transmitter is in close proximity to the vehicle, the receiver unlocks the doors. When the transmitter is out of range, the doors are locked.

PKE systems are more convenient than traditional key systems because they eliminate the need to take out a key and insert it into a lock. They are also more secure, as they are less likely to be stolen or lost.

PKE systems are becoming increasingly common on new vehicles. They are typically offered as an option on higher-trim models, but they are becoming more affordable as the technology becomes more widespread.
