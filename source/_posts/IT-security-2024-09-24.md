[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE) is a keyless entry system for vehicles that allows the user to unlock the doors and start the engine without having to remove the key from their pocket or purse. PKE systems use a combination of radio-frequency identification (RFID) and sensor technologies to detect the presence of the key and allow access to the vehicle.

RFID tags are small electronic devices that are embedded in the key or key fob. When the tag comes within close proximity to the vehicle, the RFID reader in the vehicle's antenna will detect the tag and send a signal to the vehicle's computer. The computer will then verify the identity of the key and grant access to the vehicle.

Sensor technologies are used to detect the presence of the key when it is not in close proximity to the vehicle. For example, some PKE systems use capacitive sensors to detect the presence of the key when it is placed on the door handle. Other PKE systems use motion detectors to detect the presence of the key when it is moved in close proximity to the vehicle.

PKE systems offer a number of advantages over traditional key-based entry systems. PKE systems are more convenient because the user does not have to remove the key from their pocket or purse to unlock the doors or start the engine. PKE systems are also more secure because they make it more difficult for thieves to gain access to the vehicle.

**Teenager Arrested in TfL Cyber Attack Investigation**

London's Metropolitan Police have arrested a 16-year-old boy in connection with a cyber attack on Transport for London (TfL).

The investigation is focused on a ransomware attack that took place in January 2023, which disrupted TfL's online services, including its website and mobile app.

The arrested teenager, from Oxfordshire, was taken into custody on suspicion of offenses under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. He has been released on bail while investigations continue.

TfL confirmed that its systems were targeted by a "sophisticated and targeted cyber attack" on January 25, but no customer or employee data was compromised. The incident caused widespread disruption to TfL's online platforms, with users unable to access journey planning services or make online payments.

TfL's Chief Information Officer, Shashi Verma, said: "We take the security of our systems very seriously and are working closely with the Metropolitan Police to investigate this incident. We continue to monitor our systems closely and are taking all necessary steps to protect our customers and our business."

The investigation into the TfL cyber attack is being led by the Metropolitan Police's Cyber Crime Unit, which specializes in investigating and prosecuting online criminal offenses.

Cyber attacks have become increasingly common in recent years, targeting both public and private sector organizations. Ransomware attacks, like the one experienced by TfL, involve encrypting a victim's files and demanding a payment in exchange for unlocking them.
