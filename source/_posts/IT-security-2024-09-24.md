Published: Tue, 24 Sep 2024 11:15:00 GMT

A business continuity plan (BCP) is a comprehensive plan that outlines how a business will respond to and recover from a disruptive event. The plan should include procedures for protecting employees, customers, and assets; maintaining critical operations; and restoring normal business functions as quickly as possible.

A BCP is an essential part of any business's disaster recovery planning. It can help businesses minimize the impact of a disruptive event and ensure that they can continue to operate in the face of adversity.

There are many different types of events that can disrupt a business, including natural disasters, fires, floods, cyberattacks, and terrorist attacks. A BCP should be tailored to the specific risks that a business faces.

The development of a BCP should involve all levels of the organization, from senior management to front-line employees. The plan should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that it remains current and effective.

The following are some of the key elements of a BCP:

* **Risk assessment:** This is the process of identifying and assessing the risks that a business faces. The risk assessment should consider the likelihood and potential impact of each risk.
* **Business impact analysis:** This is the process of identifying the business processes that are most critical to the organization and the potential impact of a disruption to each process.
* **Recovery strategies:** These are the steps that the business will take to recover from a disruptive event. The recovery strategies should be tailored to the specific risks that the business faces.
* **Communication plan:** This is the plan for communicating with employees, customers, and other stakeholders during a disruptive event. The communication plan should ensure that all stakeholders are kept informed of the situation and the business's response.
* **Training and exercises:** It is essential to train employees on the BCP and to conduct regular exercises to test the plan. This will help to ensure that employees are familiar with the plan and that they know how to respond to a disruptive event.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

**Passive Keyless Entry (PKE)**

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) is an automotive feature that allows drivers to unlock and lock their vehicles without using a physical key.

**How it Works:**

* **Key Fob:** The driver carries a key fob that emits a low-frequency signal.
* **Sensors:** The vehicle is equipped with sensors that detect the signal from the key fob.
* **Unlocking:** When the driver approaches the vehicle with the key fob in proximity, the sensors detect the signal and unlock the doors.
* **Locking:** When the driver leaves the vehicle and walks away, the sensors stop detecting the signal and the doors lock automatically.

**Benefits:**

* **Convenience:** No need to fumble with keys or find them in your pocket or purse.
* **Security:** Reduces the risk of theft or unauthorized entry, as the vehicle only unlocks when the authorized key fob is present.
* **Personalization:** Allows drivers to customize the lock and unlock settings, such as automatically locking the doors when the vehicle starts moving.

**Other PKE Features:**

* **Remote Start:** Some PKE systems allow drivers to start their vehicles remotely using the key fob.
* **Trunk Release:** PKE systems can also unlock the trunk or tailgate.
* **Motion Detection:** Advanced PKE systems can detect movement inside the vehicle and alert the driver.

**Additional Notes:**

* PKE systems typically have a range of a few feet.
* The key fob may need to be replaced if it runs out of battery or becomes damaged.
* Some PKE systems may have limitations, such as not working properly in certain weather conditions or when the vehicle is parked near other vehicles with PKE systems.
