[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366611295/NCSC-exposes-Chinese-company-running-malicious-Mirai-botnet)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 13:18:00 GMT

**NCSC Exposes Chinese Company Running Malicious Mirai Botnet**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has exposed a Chinese company, Venustech, for running a malicious Mirai botnet that targeted devices and networks around the world.

**Mirai Botnet**

Mirai is a malware that infects devices such as routers, cameras, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Once infected, these devices become part of a botnet, allowing attackers to control them remotely. Mirai botnets have been used to launch large-scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, disrupting websites and online services.

**Venustech's Involvement**

The NCSC investigation revealed that Venustech had created a "sinkhole" infrastructure to redirect traffic from Mirai-infected devices. This allowed Venustech to collect sensitive information from compromised devices and control the botnet's activities.

**Impact of the Exposure**

The NCSC's exposure of Venustech has several significant implications:

* **Increased Awareness:** It raises awareness about the threat posed by Mirai botnets and the importance of securing IoT devices.
* **Operational Disruption:** Venustech's sinkhole infrastructure has been disrupted, reducing the botnet's capabilities.
* **International Collaboration:** The NCSC worked with international partners to gather evidence and take action against Venustech.

**NCSC's Recommendations**

The NCSC recommends the following steps to protect against Mirai and other botnet threats:

* Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
* Keep software, firmware, and operating systems up to date.
* Install antivirus and firewall software.
* Limit access to sensitive data and networks.
* Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

**Conclusion**

The NCSC's exposure of Venustech highlights the ongoing threat posed by malicious botnets. By taking steps to secure IoT devices and network infrastructure, organizations can reduce their vulnerability to these attacks.

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/spam)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Email Spam**

Email spam is the unsolicited, bulk sending of unwanted electronic mail. It can take various forms, including:

* Commercial advertisements
* Malware or phishing scams
* Political solicitations
* Fake news and misinformation
* Personal attacks or harassment

**How to Fight Email Spam**

**1. Use Reputable Email Providers:**

Choose email providers that offer robust spam filtering, such as Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo Mail.

**2. Enable Spam Filters:**

Check your email settings and make sure spam filters are enabled. Most email providers have built-in filters that catch most spam messages.

**3. Report Spam:**

When you receive a spam email, report it to your email provider. This helps improve spam detection algorithms.

**4. Protect Your Address:**

Avoid sharing your email address publicly on websites or social media. Use temporary email addresses when signing up for online services.

**5. Use Anti-Spam Software:**

Install anti-spam software on your computer or device. These programs can filter incoming emails and block spam from reaching your inbox.

**6. Be Wary of Phishing Emails:**

Phishing emails often impersonate legitimate organizations and try to trick you into providing personal information. Never click on links or open attachments in suspicious emails.

**7. Use Caution When Opening Attachments:**

Attachments from unknown senders can contain malware. Be cautious about opening attachments, especially if the file extension is not familiar.

**8. Consider Anti-Spam Appliances:**

For businesses or organizations that receive a high volume of emails, dedicated anti-spam appliances can provide more advanced filtering and protection.

**Additional Tips:**

* Unsubscribe from marketing emails you don't want.
* Use a disposable email address for non-essential subscriptions.
* Change your password regularly to prevent hackers from accessing your account.
* Educate yourself and others about email spam and how to avoid it.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

**Passive Keyless Entry (PKE)**

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) is a feature that allows drivers to lock, unlock, and start their vehicles without using a physical key.

**How it Works:**

* **Proximity Sensor:** A sensor in the vehicle detects the presence of a compatible key fob nearby.
* **Radio Frequency Identification (RFID):** The key fob emits a unique RFID signal.
* **Antenna:** The vehicle's antenna receives the RFID signal from the key fob and identifies the authorized user.
* **Unlocking:** When the driver approaches the vehicle with the key fob, the sensors unlock the doors automatically.
* **Starting:** The driver can then get into the vehicle and start the engine by pressing a button (or using a remote starter).

**Benefits:**

* **Convenience:** Drivers can enter and start their vehicles without fumbling for keys.
* **Security:** The system is designed to prevent unauthorized access, as the key fob must be in close proximity to the vehicle.
* **Hands-free Access:** Drivers can unlock the car with their hands full, making it easier to carry groceries or other items.

**Components:**

* Key fob with RFID chip
* Proximity sensors in the vehicle
* Antenna
* Control module

**Note:**

* PKE systems may have different levels of functionality, such as remote start, trunk release, and window opening.
* The key fob must be within a certain range (typically a few meters) of the vehicle for the system to work.

**Cyber Workforce Shortage Threatens Global Security**

The global cybersecurity workforce must nearly double in size to meet the rapidly growing demand for skilled professionals. Experts predict a shortfall of 3.5 million cybersecurity professionals by 2025, posing a significant risk to businesses and governments worldwide.

**Drivers of the Shortage**

Several factors contribute to the acute shortage of cybersecurity talent:

* **Increasing Cyber Threats:** The rise of sophisticated cyberattacks, including ransomware and data breaches, has created an urgent need for skilled cybersecurity defenders.
* **Digital Transformation:** The widespread adoption of digital technologies, such as cloud computing and IoT, has exposed organizations to new cybersecurity risks that require specialized knowledge.
* **Lack of Education and Training:** Educational institutions struggle to keep pace with the rapid evolution of cybersecurity technology, resulting in a skills gap between graduates and industry needs.

**Consequences of the Shortage**

The cybersecurity talent shortage has serious consequences for both businesses and governments:

* **Increased Cyber Vulnerabilities:** Without sufficient qualified professionals, organizations are more susceptible to cyberattacks, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and disruption of services.
* **Slowed Innovation:** The shortage of cybersecurity talent can hinder the development and deployment of new technologies, limiting economic growth and innovation.
* **National Security Risks:** Insufficient cybersecurity capabilities can expose critical infrastructure, sensitive data, and national security interests to cyber threats.

**Closing the Gap**

Addressing the cybersecurity talent shortage requires a comprehensive approach:

* **Investing in Education:** Educational institutions must prioritize cybersecurity curricula and provide students with hands-on training in industry-relevant skills.
* **Government Support:** Governments can provide incentives for cybersecurity education and training programs, including scholarships, grants, and apprenticeship opportunities.
* **Industry Collaboration:** Businesses can partner with educational institutions and training providers to develop curriculum and offer internship programs that bridge the skills gap.
* **Attracting Women and Minorities:** The cybersecurity workforce is predominantly male and white. Encouraging women and minorities to pursue cybersecurity careers can expand the talent pool.

**Conclusion**

The global cybersecurity workforce shortage is a pressing concern that requires immediate attention. If not addressed, it will have severe consequences for businesses, governments, and national security. By investing in education, supporting government initiatives, and fostering industry collaboration, we can close the talent gap and equip organizations with the skilled professionals needed to protect against evolving cyber threats.
