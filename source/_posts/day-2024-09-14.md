Today is Sun in Shanghai, i had walk up at seven o'colck. The last day of the work week.

Tommorrow is Sunday, the first day of The Mid-Autumn Festival. We have three days to rest. I hope I can have a good weekend holiday. Why we have three days to rest? Because we change the work day off on Monday, The Mid-Autum Festival is a public holiday in China.

How to spend the holiday? I will go to the park with my family, and then we will have a picnic. I hope we can have a good time. I hope Olin can get well soon. He is very cute, I love him very much. My wife is very beautiful, I love her very much. She told me that she is not happy, because she is very tired. I hope she can get well soon.

In the Holiday, I will continue to study English, I want to pass the PST test. and finish school.

We are talk about how to set up home in Shanghai? If you want to settle down in Shanghai, and you need do something for your dream?
