* IAM manages the lifecycle of user identities, including creation, modification, and deactivation.
* It ensures that identities are unique, non-repetitive, and associated with the appropriate security attributes.

**4. Single Sign-On (SSO):**
* SSO enables users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials.
* This eliminates the need for remembering and managing multiple passwords, reducing the risk of credential compromise.

**5. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
* MFA requires users to provide multiple factors of authentication, such as a password, token, or biometric data.
* This adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access, even if one factor is compromised.

**6. Privileged Access Management (PAM):**
* IAM systems manage and control access to privileged accounts and resources.
* They enforce least-privilege principles and limit the scope of administrative privileges to prevent abuse and malicious activities.

**7. Session Management:**
* IAM monitors and manages user sessions to prevent unauthorized access due to session hijacking or inactivity.
* It establishes session timeouts and revokes sessions when necessary.

By integrating IAM into DiD frameworks, organizations can:

* **Reduce the risk of unauthorized access:** IAM controls user access and prevents unauthorized individuals from gaining access to sensitive data.
* **Protect data integrity:** Access control and identity management mechanisms ensure that only authorized users can modify or view data, protecting its confidentiality and integrity.
* **Maintain system availability:** SSO and session management reduce the risk of system outages due to credential-related issues or session hijacking.
* **Comply with regulatory requirements:** IAM aligns with industry and government regulations that mandate the establishment of robust access control mechanisms.

In summary, IAM within DiD frameworks provides a comprehensive approach to secure information systems by managing user identities, enforcing access control, preventing unauthorized access, and maintaining system availability. It complements other security controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and data encryption to create a multi-layered defense against cyber threats.
