You are absolutely right. A coherent Labour cyber strategy depends heavily on consistency. This is true for several reasons:

**1. Building Trust:** 
* A consistent approach to cyber policy builds trust with businesses, individuals, and international partners. 
* Inconsistent policies can lead to confusion, uncertainty, and reluctance to adopt security measures.

**2. Effective Implementation:**
* Consistency across different departments and agencies is crucial for effective implementation. 
* A fragmented approach can result in duplication of effort, missed opportunities, and lack of coordination.

**3. Long-Term Vision:**
* A coherent cyber strategy requires a long-term vision that is not swayed by short-term political pressures. 
* Consistent policies allow for the development of a comprehensive plan to address evolving cyber threats and vulnerabilities.

**4. Strategic Partnerships:**
* Consistent policies are essential for building and maintaining strategic partnerships with other countries, tech companies, and research institutions. 
* A lack of consistency can undermine international collaboration efforts.

**5. Public Perception:**
* Consistency in messaging and action helps to build public confidence and understanding of cyber threats and the government's response. 
* Inconsistent policies can lead to public skepticism and a reluctance to cooperate with cybersecurity initiatives.

**To achieve consistency in a Labour cyber strategy, the party should:**

* **Develop a comprehensive, long-term plan:** This plan should outline clear goals, objectives, and priorities for cybersecurity.
* **Establish a dedicated cyber security unit:** This unit should be responsible for coordinating and implementing the cyber strategy across all departments and agencies.
* **Ensure consistent messaging:** The Labour party should communicate a clear and consistent message about its approach to cybersecurity, both domestically and internationally.
* **Work with industry and academia:** Collaboration with these stakeholders is essential for developing effective cybersecurity policies and solutions.
* **Invest in education and awareness:** The public needs to be educated about cyber threats and how to protect themselves online.

By focusing on consistency, Labour can develop a robust and effective cyber strategy that will protect the UK from the growing threat of cyberattacks.
