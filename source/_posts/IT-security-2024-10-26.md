## Robust cloud IAM should align to zero-trust principles
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Robust-cloud-IAM-should-align-to-zero-trust-principles)

Published: Fri, 11 Oct 2024 13:26:00 GMT

**How does robust cloud IAM align with zero-trust principles?**

Robust cloud identity and access management (IAM) is critical to implementing a zero-trust security model. Zero trust is a security framework that assumes that no one, inside or outside the organization, is inherently trusted. This means that all users and devices must be verified and authorized before being granted access to any resources.

Cloud IAM can help you implement zero trust by providing the following capabilities:

* **Identity and access management:** Cloud IAM allows you to manage the identities of users and devices in your organization. You can create and manage user accounts, assign roles and permissions, and enforce multi-factor authentication.
* **Authorization:** Cloud IAM allows you to control who has access to your resources. You can create and manage access policies that define who can access which resources and under what conditions.
* **Auditing:** Cloud IAM provides auditing capabilities that allow you to track who accessed your resources and what they did. This information can be used to investigate security incidents and identify potential threats.

By using Cloud IAM to implement zero trust, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your resources. This can help you protect your organization from data breaches, malware infections, and other security threats.

**Here are some specific examples of how Cloud IAM can be used to implement zero trust principles:**

* **Use multi-factor authentication to verify the identity of users and devices.** Multi-factor authentication requires users to provide two or more pieces of evidence before being granted access to a resource. This makes it more difficult for attackers to gain access to your resources, even if they have stolen a user's password.
* **Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit the permissions of users and devices.** RBAC allows you to assign users and devices to specific roles, which define the permissions that they have. This helps to ensure that users only have access to the resources that they need to perform their jobs.
* **Use access policies to control who can access your resources.** Access policies allow you to define the conditions under which users and devices can access your resources. This helps to ensure that only authorized users and devices can access your resources.
* **Use auditing to track who accessed your resources and what they did.** Auditing can help you investigate security incidents and identify potential threats. This information can be used to improve your security posture and prevent future attacks.

By implementing these zero-trust principles, you can help to protect your organization from unauthorized access to your resources.

Threat intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information about potential threats to an organization. This information can be used to help organizations identify and mitigate risks, make informed decisions, and protect their assets.

Threat intelligence can come from a variety of sources, including open source intelligence (OSINT), closed source intelligence (CSINT), and human intelligence (HUMINT). OSINT is information that is publicly available, such as news articles, blog posts, and social media posts. CSINT is information that is not publicly available, such as government reports and intelligence briefings. HUMINT is information that is collected from human sources, such as interviews and interrogations.

Once information has been collected, it is analyzed and disseminated to stakeholders within the organization. This information can be used to help organizations identify and mitigate risks, make informed decisions, and protect their assets.

Threat intelligence is a critical tool for organizations that want to protect themselves from potential threats. By understanding the threats that they face, organizations can take steps to mitigate those risks and protect their assets.
