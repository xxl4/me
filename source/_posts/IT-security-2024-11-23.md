It uses new evasion techniques to avoid detection and has added new features, such as the ability to steal cookies and browser data. It also has a modular architecture that allows it to be easily customized for different attacks, IBM said.

Volt Typhoon is a botnet that is used to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, and distribute malware. It is known for its use of sophisticated techniques to evade detection and disruption. The original Volt Typhoon botnet was taken down in a joint international operation in March 2022, but it quickly rebuilt itself. The new version of the botnet is even more resilient and capable than the original, IBM said.

The return of Volt Typhoon is a reminder that botnets are a serious threat to businesses and organizations. Botnets can be used to launch a variety of attacks, including DDoS attacks, data breaches, and malware distribution. They are also often used to support other criminal activities, such as fraud and spam.

Businesses and organizations need to take steps to protect themselves from botnets. This includes using security software that can detect and block botnet traffic, as well as implementing strong security practices to prevent their systems from being infected with malware.
