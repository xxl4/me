Today is The Mid-Autumn Festival, the moon is very round and bright. I went to the park and saw the moon. I also ate moon cakes. I am very happy. I hope everyone is nice today.

I give my father a call, he is very happy to hear my voice. and tell me that he got two red envelopes from my brother and my brother's sister-in-law.I am very happy for him. Maybe i should give him a red envelope too.  But i don't have much money now.  My money is all in my wife's hand. I have to ask her for money. I don't like it.

My Son and my Wife stay at home all day. I don't know what they do. I don't want to ask. I don't want to know. I am not happy with them. My son has sick for a few time, and his throats is not good. I don't know what to do. I am very sad. Maybe the wether is so hot. and open the air conditioner all day is not good for health. They don't go out for a long time. One watch phone, other play ipad game all day.

I use my wife free coffee coupon to order a coffee. I like drink coffee. and have a free coffee coupon every month.

Coffee is not good for health. I know. But i like it. I can't stop it. but I will try to drink less.

Happy Mid-Autumn Festival. I hope everyone is nice today.
