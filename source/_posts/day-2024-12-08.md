Today is Sunday. I woke up at 9:30 am. don't want to get up. I stayed in bed for a while. I got up at 10:30 am. And open the window to let the fresh air in. turn on the computer and view the news and emails. I don't have breakfast. Maybe i don't have breakfast habit. 

I share some video and photos to my father. He is happy to see the video and photos. I am happy to see his smile. But my father is not good at using the phone. He can't use the phone to take photos and videos. I hope he can learn to use the phone to take photos and videos.
