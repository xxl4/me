Today is Sunday. I woke up at 9:30 am. don't want to get up. I stayed in bed for a while. I got up at 10:30 am. And open the window to let the fresh air in. turn on the computer and view the news and emails. I don't have breakfast. Maybe i don't have breakfast habit. 

I share some video and photos to my father. He is happy to see the video and photos. I am happy to see his smile. But my father is not good at using the phone. He can't use the phone to take photos and videos. I hope he can learn to use the phone to take photos and videos.

Today our topic is about WebRTC. WebRTC is a free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) via simple application programming interfaces (APIs). It allows audio and video communication to work inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication, eliminating the need to install plugins or download native apps. It is being standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

WebRTC is a set of technologies that enable real-time, peer-to-peer communication over the web. It includes protocols for signaling, secure media transport, and NAT traversal. WebRTC is supported by major browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

I know it that many companies use WebRTC to build their products. I hope I can learn more about WebRTC
