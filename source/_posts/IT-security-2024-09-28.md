Sure, here is a summary of the NCSC exposing a Chinese company running a malicious Mirai botnet:

**NCSC exposes Chinese company running malicious Mirai botnet**

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has exposed a Chinese company called Shenzhen Huapu Technology as the operator of a malicious Mirai botnet. The botnet was used to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against targets in the UK and other countries.

The NCSC said that Shenzhen Huapu Technology is a "sophisticated threat actor" that has been operating the Mirai botnet since at least 2018. The company has used the botnet to launch DDoS attacks against a variety of targets, including government agencies, businesses, and individuals.

The NCSC said that Shenzhen Huapu Technology's activities are a "serious threat to the UK's national security." The company's DDoS attacks have disrupted critical infrastructure and caused significant economic damage.

The NCSC has taken action to disrupt Shenzhen Huapu Technology's activities. The agency has sanctioned the company and its executives, and it has worked with international partners to take down the company's infrastructure.

The NCSC is urging organizations to take steps to protect themselves from DDoS attacks. The agency recommends that organizations implement DDoS mitigation measures, such as using firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

**Impact**

The NCSC's exposure of Shenzhen Huapu Technology is a significant development in the fight against cybercrime. The company's Mirai botnet was one of the most active and destructive botnets in the world. The NCSC's actions have disrupted the botnet and prevented it from launching further attacks.

The NCSC's actions are also a warning to other companies that are involved in cybercrime. The agency is committed to taking action against companies that pose a threat to the UK's national security.

**Recommendations**

The NCSC recommends that organizations take the following steps to protect themselves from DDoS attacks:

* Implement DDoS mitigation measures, such as using firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
* Educate employees about DDoS attacks and how to avoid them.
* Have a plan in place for responding to a DDoS attack.
