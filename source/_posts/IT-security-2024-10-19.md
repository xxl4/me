## What is tailgating (piggybacking)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/tailgating-piggybacking)

Published: Thu, 17 Oct 2024 18:01:00 GMT

Tailgating or piggybacking is a type of unauthorized physical access to a controlled area. It occurs when an unauthorized person follows closely behind an authorized person who has just used an access control system, such as a door or gate, to gain entry. 

The unauthorized person can then slip into the controlled area without having to provide any credentials or authorization. Tailgating can be a serious security risk, as it can allow unauthorized individuals to gain access to sensitive areas or information. 

To prevent tailgating, organizations can implement a number of security measures, such as: 

* **Using mantrap systems:** Mantrap systems require authorized individuals to pass through two sets of doors in order to gain access to a controlled area. This makes it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to tailgate. 

* **Installing access control systems:** Access control systems can be used to restrict access to controlled areas to authorized individuals only. These systems can be configured to require the use of a key card, PIN, or other form of credential to gain entry. 

* **Educating employees and visitors:** Organizations should educate employees and visitors about the risks of tailgating and how to prevent it. This education can be provided through security awareness training programs or through the use of signage.
