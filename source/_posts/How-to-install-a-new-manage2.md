# How to install a new Magento2 Application

In this tutorial, we will learn how to install a new Magento 2 application on your server. We will use the following steps:

1. Download the Magento 2 installation package

2. Create a new database

3. Run the Magento 2 installation wizard

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Download the Magento 2 installation package

First, we need to download the Magento 2 installation package from the official Magento website. You can download the latest version of Magento 2 from the following link: [Magento 2 Download](https://magento.com/tech-resources/download).

Once you have downloaded the installation package, extract it to your web server's document root directory.

## Step 2: Create a new database

Next, we need to create a new database for our Magento 2 installation. You can create a new database using the following commands:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE magento2;
CREATE USER 'magento2'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON magento2.* TO 'magento2'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Make sure to replace `magento2`, `magento2`, and `password` with your desired database name, username, and password.

## Step 3: Run the Magento 2 installation wizard

Now that we have downloaded the Magento 2 installation package and created a new database, we can run the Magento 2 installation wizard. Open your web browser and navigate to your Magento 2 installation URL (e.g., `http://example.com`).

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. You will need to enter your database connection details, admin user information, and other configuration settings.

Once the installation is complete, you will have a new Magento 2 application up and running on your server. Congratulations!

That's it! You have successfully installed a new Magento 2 application on your server. Happy selling!
