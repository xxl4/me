It's a rainy day in Shanghai. The rain is pouring down, and the streets are wet. The sound of raindrops hitting the ground is soothing, and the air smells fresh. I love rainy days like this. They make me feel calm and peaceful.

I'm walking down the street, holding an umbrella to shield myself from the rain. The city looks different in the rain. The colors are more vibrant, and everything seems to sparkle. I love watching the raindrops fall on the leaves of the trees and the petals of the flowers.

I stop at a caf√© and order a cup of hot tea. The warmth of the tea feels comforting, and the aroma is delightful. I sit by the window and watch the rain falling outside. It's a beautiful sight.

My clothes are damp, and my shoes are wet, but i don't mind. I enjoy the feeling of being out in the rain. It's refreshing and invigorating. I feel alive and connected to the world around me.

When i got company, i put off my umbrella and shoes, because i want to feel the rain on my skin and let my feet touch the wet ground. 

So beautiful, so peaceful, so calm. I love rainy days in Shanghai. They make me feel alive.
