It's a rainy day in Shanghai. The rain is pouring down, and the streets are wet. The sound of raindrops hitting the ground is soothing, and the air smells fresh. I love rainy days like this. They make me feel calm and peaceful.

I'm walking down the street, holding an umbrella to shield myself from the rain. The city looks different in the rain. The colors are more vibrant, and everything seems to sparkle. I love watching the raindrops fall on the leaves of the trees and the petals of the flowers.

I stop at a breakfast stand and order an egg and a package of soy milk. The vendor smiles at me and hands me my food that i paid for. I take it and continue walking. The rain is falling harder now, but i don't mind. I enjoy the feeling of being out in the rain. It's refreshing and invigorating. I feel alive and connected to the world around me.

My clothes are damp, and my shoes are wet, but i don't mind. I enjoy the feeling of being out in the rain. It's refreshing and invigorating. I feel alive and connected to the world around me.

When i got company, i put off my umbrella and shoes, because i want to feel the rain on my skin and let my feet touch the wet ground. 

So beautiful, so peaceful, so calm. I love rainy days in Shanghai. They make me feel alive.

When i know my son is not all right with his homework, i have to talk to his mother, let her know the situation, and ask her to help him. I know she is not happy with me, but i have to do it. I have to be responsible for my son. I have to be a good father.
