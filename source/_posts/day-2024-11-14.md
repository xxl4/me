Today I had wake up at 6:30 am, and then I went to the hotel restaurant for breakfast. I had a egg and a bowl of rice porridge. After breakfast, I went to the court with my laywer. We had a meeting with the judge and the other party's Lawyer. The judge asked me to provide more evidence to support my claim. 

After the meeting, I went back to the hotel and had lunch. I had a bowl of noodles and a cup of tea. After lunch, I went to the bus station and took a bus to the train station. I took a train to Shanghai and arrived at the Shanghai train station at 7:00 am. I took subway to company and arrived at the company at 8:00 am. 

I don't have eat dinner today, because I don't want to eat alone. I went to the hotel and went to bed early. I hope tomorrow will be a better day.
