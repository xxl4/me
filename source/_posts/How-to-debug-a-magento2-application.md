# How to debug a Magento2 application

In this tutorial, we will learn how to debug a Magento 2 application using Xdebug. We will use the following steps:

1. Install Xdebug
2. Configure Xdebug
3. Debug a Magento 2 application

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Install Xdebug

First, we need to install Xdebug on our server. You can install Xdebug using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-xdebug
```

## Step 2: Configure Xdebug

Next, we need to configure Xdebug in our `php.ini` file. Open your `php.ini` file and add the following lines at the end of the file:

```ini
zend_extension=xdebug.so
xdebug.remote_enable=1
xdebug.remote_autostart=1

; Optional: Set the remote host and port
xdebug.remote_host=
xdebug.remote_port=
```

## Step 3: Debug a Magento2 application

Now that Xdebug is installed and configured, we can start debugging our Magento 2 application. To debug a Magento 2 application, follow these steps:

1. Set a breakpoint in your code

2. Start a debugging session in your IDE

3. Trigger the code execution in your Magento 2 application

4. The debugger will stop at the breakpoint, and you can inspect the variables, stack trace, and more

That's it! You have successfully debugged a Magento 2 application using Xdebug. Happy debugging!
