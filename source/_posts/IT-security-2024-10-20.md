[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/tailgating-piggybacking)

Published: Thu, 17 Oct 2024 18:01:00 GMT

**Tailgating (Piggybacking)**

Tailgating refers to the unauthorized access to a secured area or system by following closely behind an authorized person who has recently gained access. It is also known as "piggybacking."

**How It Works:**

1. An authorized person gains access to a secured area (e.g., a building, network, or system) through a legitimate means such as a key card or password.
2. Immediately behind the authorized person, an unauthorized individual enters the secured area by trailing them.
3. The unauthorized individual takes advantage of the open door or unlocked system left behind by the authorized person to gain access.

**Consequences of Tailgating:**

Tailgating can compromise the security of an organization by:

* **Unauthorized Access:** Allowing access to sensitive areas, data, or systems to unauthorized individuals.
* **Data Breaches:** Enabling data theft, manipulation, or destruction.
* **Physical Security Breaches:** Allowing unauthorized individuals to enter physical spaces and potentially harm personnel or property.
* **Reputation Damage:** Loss of trust and damage to the organization's reputation.

**Prevention Measures:**

To prevent tailgating, organizations can implement measures such as:

* **Access Control Systems:** Use physical barriers (e.g., turnstiles) and electronic access systems (e.g., card readers) to restrict access to authorized personnel only.
* **Tailgating Detection Systems:** Utilize sensors and cameras to detect unauthorized individuals who follow behind authorized persons.
* **Security Guards:** Place security personnel at entry points to monitor for tailgating and intervene if necessary.
* **Employee Education and Training:** Educate employees about the risks of tailgating and encourage them to report any suspicious activity.
* **Culture of Security:** Foster a culture of workplace security where employees prioritize following security protocols and avoid complacency.

## Secureworks: Ransomware takedowns didn’t put off cyber criminals

**Title:** Ransomware Takedowns Didn't Deter Cyber Criminals

**Summary:**

Secureworks, a cybersecurity firm, conducted a study and found that law enforcement takedowns of ransomware operations have not deterred cybercriminals from continuing their activities. 

**Key Findings:**

* **Shift to "Ransomware-as-a-Service":** Cybercriminals are increasingly adopting the "Ransomware-as-a-Service" (RaaS) model, where they lease out their ransomware tools and infrastructure to other criminals. This allows them to remain anonymous and avoid direct law enforcement action.
* **Innovation in Ransomware Techniques:** Ransomware attackers are constantly evolving their techniques to evade detection and avoid takedowns. They are using new encryption methods, targeting IoT devices, and adopting double extortion tactics (stealing data and threatening to release it if the ransom is not paid).
* **Limited Deterrence Effect:** Law enforcement takedowns of ransomware gangs have a temporary deterrent effect, but cybercriminals quickly adapt and return to their operations. They often set up new infrastructure and launch new attacks within a short period of time.

**Implications:**

* Organizations should not rely solely on law enforcement takedowns to protect themselves from ransomware.
* Businesses and individuals need to implement robust cybersecurity measures, including regular software updates, multi-factor authentication, and backups.
* Collaboration between government agencies, law enforcement, and the cybersecurity industry is crucial to address the ongoing threat of ransomware.

**Additional Insights:**

* The study also found that the average ransom payment has increased significantly, reflecting the high impact of ransomware attacks.
* Cybercriminals are targeting critical infrastructure, such as healthcare and energy companies, which can have devastating consequences.
* The lack of deterrence from law enforcement takedowns highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach to combating ransomware, including education, prevention, and international cooperation.

* The law will require organizations to report certain types of cyber incidents to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).
* Reportable incidents include those that have a significant impact on national security, public health, or the economy.
* Organizations will have a deadline of 72 hours to report incidents, with potential fines for non-compliance.
* The law aims to improve the UK's cybersecurity posture by enabling the government to identify and respond to threats more effectively.

**Organizations Affected:**

The law will apply to:

* Operators of essential services (e.g., energy, water, transportation)
* Providers of digital services (e.g., online banking, social media)
* Critical national infrastructure operators (e.g., telecommunications, defense)

**Benefits:**

* Improved detection and response to cyber threats
* Reduced risk of systemic cybersecurity incidents
* Enhanced coordination between organizations and government agencies
* Increased awareness of cyber risks among businesses and consumers

**Challenges:**

* Defining what constitutes a "significant" cyber incident may be challenging.
* Organizations may face increased burden and costs associated with reporting and compliance.
* Potential for over-reporting and false positives.

**Timeline:**

* The law is expected to be passed in Parliament in 2023.
* The NCSC will develop guidance and support for organizations.
* The reporting obligation will come into effect in 2025.

**Conclusion:**

The UK's cyber incident reporting law is a significant step towards strengthening the country's cybersecurity posture. While the law presents challenges and requires careful implementation, its benefits potentially outweigh the costs. By improving collaboration and information sharing, the law aims to make the UK a more secure and resilient society in the face of evolving cyber threats.
