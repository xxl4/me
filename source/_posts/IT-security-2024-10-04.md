**Redmond, WA – August 4, 2022**

Microsoft Corporation announced today that it has filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington to seize 65 internet domains used by a Russian military intelligence agency, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU). 

The lawsuit alleges that a GRU unit known as Unit 74455 used the domains to conduct cyberattacks against Ukraine and other countries, including the United States. The attacks, which began in 2015, have targeted critical infrastructure, government agencies, and private companies.

In the lawsuit, Microsoft alleges that the GRU used the domains to:

* Conduct phishing attacks to steal credentials and other sensitive information.
* Spread malware and ransomware.
* Conduct disinformation campaigns to sow discord and undermine trust in democratic institutions.
* Target critical infrastructure, such as power grids and water systems.

Microsoft's lawsuit is the latest in a series of actions taken by the company to combat cyberattacks from Russia. In recent months, Microsoft has disrupted several GRU-linked cyberattacks, including an attack on Ukraine's power grid in 2016 and an attack on the Olympic Winter Games in 2018.

"Microsoft is committed to protecting our customers from cyberattacks," said Tom Burt, Microsoft's corporate vice president for customer security & trust. "This lawsuit is part of our ongoing effort to disrupt Russia's malicious cyber activities and to hold the GRU accountable for its attacks."

The lawsuit seeks to seize the 65 domains used by the GRU and to prevent the GRU from using them for further attacks. Microsoft is also seeking damages from the GRU for the harm caused by its cyberattacks.

The lawsuit is a significant step in Microsoft's efforts to combat cyberattacks from Russia. It is the first time that the company has filed a lawsuit to seize domains used by a foreign intelligence agency. The lawsuit is also the first time that Microsoft has sought damages from a foreign intelligence agency for cyberattacks.

Microsoft's lawsuit is a reminder of the growing threat of cyberattacks from Russia. In recent years, Russia has been responsible for some of the most sophisticated and damaging cyberattacks in history. These attacks have targeted a wide range of targets, including critical infrastructure, government agencies, and private companies.

In a startling revelation, it has come to light that Evil Corp has been collaborating with the notorious ransomware group LockBit. LockBit operates a RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service) platform that provides aspiring cybercriminals with the tools and infrastructure to launch their own ransomware attacks.

Evil Corp's collaboration with LockBit has elevated its threat level significantly. By leveraging LockBit's advanced ransomware capabilities, the gang has been able to target larger and more valuable organizations, amplifying the financial and reputational damage they inflict.

**Modus Operandi**

Evil Corp typically gains access to victim networks through phishing emails or by exploiting vulnerabilities in software systems. Once inside, the gang deploys LockBit ransomware, which encrypts critical files, rendering them inaccessible to the victims.

The gang then demands a hefty ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key. Failure to pay within a specified timeframe results in the stolen data being leaked or sold on the dark web.

**Arrests and Investigations**

In a major breakthrough, law enforcement agencies in the United States and Ukraine have collaborated to arrest several members of Evil Corp, including Maxim himself. The arrests have disrupted the gang's operations and sent a strong message that cybercrime will not be tolerated.

However, it is believed that remnants of Evil Corp still remain active, and they are likely to continue their malicious activities, possibly under different names or in collaboration with other cybercriminal groups.
