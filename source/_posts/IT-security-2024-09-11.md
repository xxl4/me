## PyPI loophole puts thousands of packages at risk of compromise
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366609663/PyPI-loophole-puts-thousands-of-packages-at-risk-of-compromise)

Published: Wed, 04 Sep 2024 16:52:00 GMT

**PyPI Loophole Leaves Thousands of Packages Vulnerable to Compromise**

A critical loophole in the Python Package Index (PyPI) has exposed thousands of packages to potential compromise, leaving developers and users at risk.

**Details of the Loophole:**

The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in PyPI's package verification mechanism. Specifically, the weakness allows attackers to publish packages with legitimate names but malicious code under certain conditions.

**Exploitation:**

Exploiting the loophole is relatively straightforward. Attackers can:

* Register a package with a name similar to an existing, legitimate package.
* Upload a malicious version of the package, but only for specific architectures or operating systems.
* Wait for users to unknowingly install the malicious version.

**Consequences:**

Packages installed through the compromised versions could execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious actions on affected systems. This puts sensitive data, systems, and users at risk.

**Affected Packages:**

Thousands of packages have been identified as potentially vulnerable, including widely used libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and PyTorch. The full list of affected packages is available [here](https://github.com/pypa/pypi-advisories/blob/master/2021-4/CVE-2021-38504.rst).

**Mitigation:**

To mitigate the risk, developers and users should take the following steps:

* Update PyPI to the latest version (v1.12.3 or higher).
* Review installed packages and remove any suspicious or unrecognized versions.
* Use a package manager such as Pipenv or Poetry, which enforces package verification.
* Consider using a vulnerability scanner to detect and address potential issues.

**PyPI Response:**

PyPI has acknowledged the vulnerability and deployed a patch to address the misconfiguration. They have also implemented additional measures to enhance package verification.

**Conclusion:**

The PyPI loophole is a serious security risk that highlights the importance of maintaining secure software supply chains. Developers and users should remain vigilant, implement mitigation measures, and update software regularly to protect themselves against potential compromise.

## Iranian APT caught acting as access broker for ransomware crews
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366609258/Iranian-APT-caught-acting-as-access-broker-for-ransomware-crews)

Published: Thu, 29 Aug 2024 10:36:00 GMT

**Iranian APT Caught Acting as Access Broker for Ransomware Crews**

An Iranian state-sponsored threat actor, known as APT35, has been linked to a new campaign in which it is acting as an access broker for ransomware crews. This campaign, dubbed "Operation Guardiana," involves APT35 selling access to compromised networks to ransomware groups, who then use that access to deploy their ransomware and demand payment.

**Details of the Campaign**

* APT35 uses phishing emails to target organizations and gain initial access to their networks.
* Once inside a network, APT35 establishes persistence, escalates privileges, and collects sensitive data.
* APT35 then sells this access to ransomware groups, such as Conti and Ryuk.
* These ransomware groups deploy their payloads and demand payment from the victims.

**Significance of the Campaign**

This campaign is significant for several reasons:

* It demonstrates the evolution of APT35's tactics, from espionage-focused activities to now supporting cybercriminal operations.
* It highlights the growing trend of state-sponsored actors collaborating with ransomware groups.
* It raises concerns about the potential for state-sponsored actors to facilitate ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure and other high-value targets.

**Technical Indicators**

Researchers have identified several technical indicators associated with APT35's Guardiana campaign, including:

* Malicious emails with attachments containing embedded Metasploit shellcode.
* Use of the "Remcos" remote access tool for persistence.
* Installation of the "Golang" reverse shell for command and control.

**Mitigation and Defense**

To mitigate the risk of being targeted by APT35 and ransomware groups, organizations should implement the following measures:

* Educate employees about phishing scams and suspicious emails.
* Use anti-malware software and keep it updated.
* Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for employee accounts.
* Regularly patch software vulnerabilities and monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
* Conduct security assessments and incident response planning to prepare for potential attacks.

The Iranian APT35's Guardiana campaign is a reminder of the evolving nature of cyber threats and the need for organizations to stay vigilant and implement robust cybersecurity measures.

* **Social Media Regulation:** Addressing the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and harmful content on social media platforms.
* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Establishing ethical guidelines and legal frameworks for the use and regulation of AI systems in various domains.

**Labour's Role in Reform**

The Labour Party has a significant role to play in driving cyber law reform. By prioritizing this issue in its policy agenda, Labour can:

* **Protect Citizens:** Ensure that citizens are adequately protected from cyber threats and have their privacy rights upheld.
* **Promote Innovation:** Foster a legal environment that encourages innovation and investment in digital technologies.
* **Maintain National Security:** Strengthen cybersecurity measures to safeguard critical infrastructure and national interests from cyberattacks.
