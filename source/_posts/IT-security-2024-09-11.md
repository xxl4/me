## Iranian APT caught acting as access broker for ransomware crews
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366609258/Iranian-APT-caught-acting-as-access-broker-for-ransomware-crews)

Published: Thu, 29 Aug 2024 10:36:00 GMT

**Iranian APT Linked to Ransomware Activities**

An Iranian advanced persistent threat (APT) group, known as TA453, has been identified as an access broker for ransomware crews.

**Key Findings:**

* TA453 has been exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices and networks to gain initial access.
* The group has been selling access to these compromised systems to ransomware operators.
* Recent ransomware campaigns attributed to Conti and BlackCat have used access provided by TA453.

**Modus Operandi:**

TA453 targets organizations and individuals in various sectors, including critical infrastructure, healthcare, and academia. The group uses a combination of techniques, including phishing, malware distribution, and exploiting vulnerabilities, to compromise systems.

Once access is obtained, TA453 sells it to ransomware crews on underground forums. The ransomware operators then use the access to deploy their payloads and extort victims.

**Impact:**

The involvement of TA453 in ransomware activities has implications for organizations and individuals:

* **Increased Risk:** TA453's access brokerage services make it easier for ransomware crews to obtain initial access to victim systems, increasing the overall risk of ransomware attacks.
* **Higher Impact:** Ransomware attacks can disrupt operations, damage data, and result in financial losses. By providing access to compromised systems, TA453 facilitates the impact of ransomware campaigns.
* **Additional Targets:** TA453's activities can expand the target base for ransomware attacks, potentially targeting organizations that were previously considered less vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**

To mitigate the risks associated with TA453's activities, organizations and individuals should:

* Implement strong cybersecurity measures, such as patch management, multi-factor authentication, and endpoint protection.
* Educate employees on recognizing and reporting phishing attempts and other malicious activity.
* Monitor network activity for suspicious behavior and consider implementing intrusion detection systems.
* Have a comprehensive incident response plan in place to respond to ransomware attacks.

## Cyber law reform should be top of Labour's policy list
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Cyber-law-reform-should-be-top-of-Labours-policy-list)

Published: Thu, 29 Aug 2024 09:42:00 GMT

**Introduction**

Cyber law reform is an urgent and pressing issue that requires immediate attention from policymakers. The rapid advancement of technology has presented new challenges and opportunities, and our legal framework must evolve to keep pace. This is especially true for the Labour Party, which has a long history of championing social justice and equality.

**Cyberbullying and Harassment**

One of the most concerning issues in cyberspace is cyberbullying and harassment. The anonymity of the internet can embolden individuals to engage in harmful behavior that would be unacceptable in the physical world. This can have devastating consequences for victims, leading to psychological distress, loss of self-esteem, and even suicide. Labour must prioritize strengthening laws against cyberbullying and harassment to protect vulnerable individuals.

**Data Privacy and Protection**

The vast amounts of data generated and collected in the digital age have raised serious concerns about data privacy and protection. Companies and governments have access to unprecedented amounts of personal information, which can be used to track, profile, and even manipulate individuals. Labour must advocate for robust data privacy laws that give individuals greater control over their data and prevent its misuse.

**Cybercrime and Cybersecurity**

Cybercrime, such as hacking, phishing, and ransomware attacks, is a rapidly growing threat to individuals and businesses alike. The Labour Party must support measures to strengthen cybersecurity, including investing in law enforcement and intelligence capabilities, promoting public awareness, and holding businesses accountable for protecting user data.

**Economic Inequality and the Digital Divide**

Technology has the potential to exacerbate economic inequality and create a digital divide between those who have access to the internet and those who do not. Labour must address the social and economic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from fully participating in the digital economy. This includes expanding broadband access, providing digital literacy training, and promoting policies that create good-paying jobs in the tech sector.

**Labour's Commitment to Cyber Law Reform**

The Labour Party has a long-standing commitment to social justice and equality. In order to uphold these values in the digital age, the party must make cyber law reform a top priority. This includes:

* Enacting comprehensive legislation to prevent and punish cyberbullying and harassment
* Strengthening data privacy laws to protect individuals from data breaches and misuse
* Investing in cybersecurity to combat cybercrime and protect critical infrastructure
* Promoting digital inclusion and bridging the digital divide
* Ensuring that the digital economy benefits all, not just the privileged few

**Conclusion**

Cyber law reform is an essential undertaking for the Labour Party. By embracing these measures, Labour can create a fairer, safer, and more equitable digital society for all. By putting cyber law reform at the top of its policy list, Labour can demonstrate its commitment to social justice in the 21st century.
