## What is WAF?

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security solution that protects web applications from various types of attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common web application vulnerabilities. WAFs are designed to filter and monitor HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet, providing an additional layer of security to help protect web applications from malicious attacks.

## How does WAF work?

WAFs work by inspecting HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet, looking for suspicious activity that may indicate an attack. When a WAF detects a potential threat, it can block the malicious traffic, allowing legitimate traffic to pass through to the web application. WAFs can be deployed as a hardware appliance, a virtual appliance, or a cloud-based service, depending on the needs of the organization.

## Types of WAF

There are two main types of WAFs: network-based WAFs and host-based WAFs. Network-based WAFs are typically deployed in front of web applications and inspect all incoming HTTP traffic, while host-based WAFs are installed on the web server itself and protect the web application from attacks at the application layer. Both types of WAFs have their own strengths and weaknesses, and organizations should choose the type of WAF that best meets their security needs.

In conclusion, a WAF is an essential security solution for protecting web applications from a wide range of attacks. By filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic, WAFs can help organizations detect and block malicious activity, keeping their web applications secure and their data safe.
