# How to use Wireshark

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that can be used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education. It is widely used by network administrators and security professionals to analyze network traffic and detect network problems. Wireshark is a powerful tool that can capture and analyze network packets in real-time. It can be used to troubleshoot network problems, detect network attacks, and monitor network traffic. In this article, we will discuss how to use Wireshark to capture and analyze network packets.

## Installing Wireshark

Wireshark is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download the latest version of Wireshark from the official website [here](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html). Once you have downloaded the installer, you can install Wireshark on your computer by following the on-screen instructions.

## Capturing Packets

To capture network packets with Wireshark, you need to select a network interface to capture packets from. You can select the network interface by clicking on the "Capture" menu and then selecting "Interfaces". This will open a dialog box that shows all the available network interfaces on your computer. Select the network interface that you want to capture packets from and click on the "Start" button to start capturing packets.

Wireshark will start capturing packets from the selected network interface in real-time. You can see the captured packets in the main Wireshark window. The packets are displayed in a tabular format with detailed information about each packet, such as the source and destination IP addresses, protocol, and packet size.

## Analyzing Packets

Once you have captured packets with Wireshark, you can analyze the packets to troubleshoot network problems or detect network attacks. You can filter the captured packets by using display filters to focus on specific packets that match certain criteria. For example, you can filter packets by IP address, protocol, port number, or packet size.

You can also use Wireshark's built-in tools to analyze the captured packets. For example, you can use the "Follow TCP Stream" tool to reconstruct a TCP stream and view the data exchanged between the client and server. You can also use the "Statistics" menu to view statistics about the captured packets, such as the number of packets captured, the number of packets dropped, and the average packet size.

## Conclusion

Wireshark is a powerful network protocol analyzer that can be used to troubleshoot network problems, detect network attacks, and monitor network traffic. It is widely used by network administrators and security professionals to analyze network traffic and detect network problems. In this article, we discussed how to use Wireshark to capture and analyze network packets. We covered the installation process, capturing packets, and analyzing packets with Wireshark. We hope this article has helped you understand how to use Wireshark to troubleshoot network problems and detect network attacks.
