## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as keyless access or proximity entry, is a feature that allows you to lock or unlock your vehicle without using a physical key. Instead, PKE uses a key fob that emits a radio frequency (RF) signal when you approach the vehicle. The vehicle's receiver picks up the signal and unlocks the doors. When you leave the vehicle, the PKE system locks the doors automatically.

Keyless entry fob is a device that sends a signal to unlock your door when you're nearby. The fob emits a radio frequency (RF) signal when you approach the vehicle. The vehicle's receiver picks up the signal and unlocks the doors. When you leave the vehicle, the PKE system locks the doors automatically. Keyless entry fobs are small and can be attached to your key ring or kept in your pocket or purse.

Remote keyless entry (RKE), also known as keyless remote or key fob, is a similar feature that allows you to lock or unlock your vehicle from a distance using a key fob. However, unlike PKE, RKE requires you to press a button on the key fob to lock or unlock the doors.

Passive keyless entry is more convenient than traditional key fobs because you don't have to fumble with keys or press buttons to lock or unlock your vehicle. PKE is also more secure than traditional key fobs because it uses a rolling code system that makes it difficult for thieves to duplicate the signal.
