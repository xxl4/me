## Iranian APT caught acting as access broker for ransomware crews
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366609258/Iranian-APT-caught-acting-as-access-broker-for-ransomware-crews)

Published: Thu, 29 Aug 2024 10:36:00 GMT

**Iranian APT Acting as Access Broker for Ransomware Crews**

An Iranian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group, known as APT35 (also known as Charming Kitten), has been identified acting as an access broker for ransomware gangs. According to a recent report by Mandiant, APT35 has been selling stolen corporate network access to multiple ransomware groups.

**Modus Operandi**

APT35 targets organizations worldwide, primarily in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. It uses a variety of techniques to gain initial access, including:

* Phishing emails with malicious attachments or links
* Exploiting software vulnerabilities
* Targeting managed service providers (MSPs) to gain access to multiple client networks

Once access is established, APT35 typically moves laterally within the network, stealing credentials and compromising systems. It then exfiltrates sensitive data and sells access to the network to ransomware groups.

**Collaboration with Ransomware Crews**

APT35 has established partnerships with several ransomware gangs, including:

* Hive
* BlackCat
* Conti
* Play

These groups pay APT35 to provide them with access to corporate networks, allowing them to deploy ransomware and encrypt data without having to develop their own infrastructure or target networks independently.

**Impact on Victims**

The collaboration between APT35 and ransomware crews poses a significant threat to organizations. By combining their capabilities, these groups can target and extort victims with increased efficiency and impact.

* **Increased Network Compromises:** APT35's access brokering services enable ransomware groups to bypass traditional network defenses and gain access to otherwise secure networks.
* **Enhanced Ransomware Payouts:** With access to pre-exploited networks, ransomware gangs can demand higher ransoms, as they have a greater chance of successfully encrypting critical data.
* **Data Exfiltration and Extortion:** In addition to encrypting data, APT35 and ransomware crews may also exfiltrate sensitive information from compromised networks, which they use for further extortion attempts.

**Mitigation Measures**

To mitigate the threat posed by APT35 and ransomware crews, organizations should:

* Enhance phishing awareness and employee training
* Patch software vulnerabilities promptly
* Monitor networks for unusual activity and suspicious connections
* Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
* Consider using a managed detection and response (MDR) provider
* Back up critical data regularly and test recovery procedures
