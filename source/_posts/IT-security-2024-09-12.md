[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Kubernetes-disaster-recovery-Five-key-questions)

Published: Thu, 12 Sep 2024 11:57:00 GMT

**1. How do you replicate data in a Kubernetes cluster across multiple Availability Zones or regions?**

Replication strategies such as StatefulSets, PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), and backup solutions can ensure data persistence and availability across multiple failure domains.

**2. How do you handle node failures in a Kubernetes cluster?**

Kubernetes provides autoscaling and self-healing mechanisms to automatically replace failed nodes and maintain cluster availability.

**3. How do you recover from data loss if a Kubernetes node fails?**

Persistent storage solutions like Persistent Volumes (PVs) and backup services guarantee data durability and recovery in case of node failures.

**4. How do you protect Kubernetes secrets from unauthorized access during a disaster?**

Kubernetes secrets management best practices include using native Kubernetes secrets, external secret managers, and encryption at rest.

**5. What tools and procedures do you have in place to monitor and manage Kubernetes clusters during disaster recovery?**

Monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana provide real-time insights into cluster health, while disaster recovery plans outline clear procedures for responding to and recovering from incidents.
