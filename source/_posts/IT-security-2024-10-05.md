**Microsoft Files Lawsuit to Seize Domains Used by Russian Spooks**

**Seattle, Washington** - Microsoft has filed a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle to seize 96 domain names that it says are being used by Russian intelligence services to conduct cyberattacks and spread disinformation.

The lawsuit, which was filed on Thursday, alleges that the domains are being used by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) to target critical infrastructure, steal sensitive information, and interfere in elections.

Microsoft says that the domains are registered to front companies and individuals in Russia and other countries, but that the actual operators are Russian intelligence officers.

The lawsuit seeks to have the domains transferred to Microsoft's control and to have them blocked from access by Russian intelligence services.

"We are taking this action to protect our customers and the public from ongoing cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns by the Russian government," said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer. "We will not tolerate the use of our platform for malicious purposes."

The lawsuit is part of a broader effort by Microsoft to combat Russian cyberattacks and disinformation. In recent years, the company has filed lawsuits to seize domains used by Russian hackers and has worked with law enforcement to disrupt Russian cyberattacks.

The lawsuit is also a sign of the growing tension between the United States and Russia in cyberspace. In recent months, the two countries have traded accusations of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.

In a statement, the Russian embassy in Washington called the lawsuit "unfounded" and said that it was "part of a broader campaign to demonize Russia."

The lawsuit is expected to be heard in federal court in Seattle in the coming months.

[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366612655/Detective-behind-unlawful-surveillance-blamed-Catholics-for-perverse-court-decisions)

Published: Wed, 02 Oct 2024 13:42:00 GMT

A detective behind the “unlawful” surveillance of a Catholic priest has been accused of blaming Catholics for “perverse” court decisions.

Detective Inspector Dave Clark was part of a team that spied on Father Patrick Smythe, a priest in the Diocese of Westminster, without a warrant.

The surveillance was later ruled unlawful by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT).

In a letter to the IPT, Clark claimed that Catholics were responsible for “perverse” court decisions that had led to the Catholic Church being “exempt from the law”.

He also claimed that the Catholic Church had “a history of covering up child abuse” and that “Catholic priests are more likely to be child abusers than any other group of men”.

Clark’s comments have been condemned by the Catholic Church and by human rights groups.

A spokesperson for the Diocese of Westminster said that Clark’s comments were “offensive and inaccurate”.

“The Catholic Church has a long and proud history of serving the community, and we reject any suggestion that we are exempt from the law,” the spokesperson said.

Amnesty International said that Clark’s comments were “shocking and unacceptable”.

“It is outrageous that a police officer would make such sweeping and offensive generalizations about an entire religious group,” said Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK’s director.

“These comments undermine public trust in the police and reinforce harmful stereotypes.”

The IPT has said that it is investigating Clark’s comments.

**Detective Reported Journalist's Lawyers to Regulator in 'Unlawful' PSNI Surveillance Case**

**Belfast, Northern Ireland** - A detective has been accused of unlawfully reporting the lawyers representing a journalist to their regulator over a police surveillance case.

The detective, whose name has not been released, is alleged to have filed a complaint to the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) against Lawrence Carter-Campbell and Niall Murphy of McIvor Farrell Solicitors.

The lawyers are representing Lyra McKee, a journalist who was killed by a dissident Republican gunman in 2019. McKee had been investigating police surveillance on behalf of The Sunday Times.

The detective's complaint reportedly alleges that the lawyers discussed the case with McKee without permission from the police.

However, the lawyers have strongly denied the allegations and have accused the detective of attempting to intimidate them.

**Unlawful Surveillance**

The PSNI has admitted to unlawfully surveilling journalists in Northern Ireland for over a decade. The scandal has sparked outrage and calls for an independent public inquiry.

Last year, the High Court in Belfast ruled that the PSNI's surveillance of McKee was unlawful and violated her privacy rights.

**Independent Investigation**

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is currently investigating the PSNI's surveillance practices. The IOPC has said that the detective's complaint will be considered as part of its investigation.

**Reaction**

The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has condemned the detective's actions and called for an investigation.

"This is a blatant attempt to intimidate journalists and their lawyers," said NUJ General Secretary Michelle Stanistreet. "It is essential that journalists are able to work freely and without fear of reprisal."

The SRA has confirmed that it has received a complaint about the lawyers but declined to comment further.

The detective has not responded to requests for comment.

**Background**

The PSNI surveillance scandal was first exposed by The Sunday Times in 2020. The newspaper reported that the PSNI had been using covert surveillance techniques to monitor journalists, politicians, and other public figures.

In response, the PSNI launched a review of its surveillance practices. The review found that the PSNI had unlawfully surveilled over 1,000 people.

The scandal has led to the resignation of several senior PSNI officers, including the former Chief Constable Simon Byrne.

Published: Mon, 30 Sep 2024 15:56:00 GMT

**The cyber industry needs to accept it can't eliminate risk**

The cyber industry has been on a mission to eliminate risk for decades. But it's a futile quest. Risk is an inherent part of any system, and it can never be completely eliminated.

The sooner the cyber industry accepts this, the sooner it can start to focus on more realistic goals. Instead of trying to eliminate risk, the industry should focus on managing it. This means understanding what risks are present, assessing their likelihood and impact, and taking steps to mitigate them.

There are a number of ways to manage risk. One common approach is to use a risk management framework. A risk management framework provides a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks.

Another approach to managing risk is to use security controls. Security controls are measures that can be implemented to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk.

The cyber industry has a wealth of resources available to help organizations manage risk. These resources include risk management frameworks, security controls, and best practices.

By accepting that risk can't be eliminated and focusing on managing it, the cyber industry can help organizations to improve their security posture and protect their assets.

**Here are some specific steps that the cyber industry can take to start managing risk:**

* **Develop a risk management framework.** A risk management framework provides a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks. There are a number of different risk management frameworks available, so organizations should choose one that is appropriate for their needs.
* **Identify and assess risks.** Once an organization has a risk management framework in place, it can begin to identify and assess risks. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as interviews, surveys, and workshops.
* **Mitigate risks.** Once risks have been identified and assessed, organizations can take steps to mitigate them. This can be done through a variety of measures, such as implementing security controls, changing business processes, and providing training.
* **Monitor and review risks.** Risks should be monitored and reviewed on a regular basis. This will help to ensure that risks are being managed effectively and that new risks are identified.

## What is WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3)?

Published: Mon, 30 Sep 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) is the latest security protocol for Wi-Fi networks. It was developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance to address the weaknesses of the previousWPA2 protocol. WPA3 offers several new security features, including:

* **Enhanced encryption:** WPA3 uses a new encryption algorithm called the Galois/Counter Mode Protocol with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (GCM-AES). This algorithm is more secure than the AES algorithm used in WPA2, and it provides better protection against eavesdropping and other attacks.
* **Individualized data encryption:** WPA3 uses individualized data encryption, which means that each device connected to the network has its own unique encryption key. This makes it more difficult for attackers to intercept data from multiple devices on the same network.
* **Protection against brute-force attacks:** WPA3 uses a new key derivation function called Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE). SAE makes it more difficult for attackers to guess the password for a Wi-Fi network, even if they have access to the network's traffic.

WPA3 is a significant improvement over WPA2, and it offers strong security for Wi-Fi networks. However, it is important to note that WPA3 is not yet widely supported by all devices. If you are considering upgrading your Wi-Fi network to WPA3, you should check to make sure that your devices are compatible with the new protocol.

## UK on high alert over Iranian spear phishing attacks, says NCSC
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366612026/UK-on-high-alert-over-Iranian-spear-phishing-attacks-says-NCSC)

Published: Fri, 27 Sep 2024 14:59:00 GMT

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued a warning to UK organisations about a significant increase in spear phishing attacks from Iranian actors. These attacks are targeting a wide range of organisations, including government departments, businesses, and individuals.

The NCSC believes that these attacks are part of a wider campaign by Iran to gather intelligence and steal sensitive information. The attacks are typically carried out by sending emails that appear to come from legitimate organisations or individuals. However, these emails contain malicious attachments or links that, when clicked, can infect computers with malware.

The NCSC has advised organisations to be vigilant and to follow its advice on protecting against spear phishing attacks. This includes:

* Being cautious of emails from unknown senders
* Not clicking on links or opening attachments in emails from unknown senders
* Using strong passwords and two-factor authentication
* Keeping software up to date
* Reporting any suspicious emails to the NCSC

The NCSC is working with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to investigate these attacks and to take action against those responsible.

The warning from the NCSC is a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity. Organisations need to be aware of the threats that they face and to take steps to protect themselves.
