description: Linux curl Command Explained with Examples
---
# Introduction
Transferring data to and from a server requires tools that support the necessary network protocols. Linux has multiple tools created for this purpose, the most popular being curl and wget.

This tutorial will show you how to use the curl command and provide you with an exhaustive list of the available options.

# What Is the curl Command?
curl (short for "Client URL") is a command line tool that enables data transfer over various network protocols. It communicates with a web or application server by specifying a relevant URL and the data that need to be sent or received.

curl is powered by libcurl, a portable client-side URL transfer library. You can use it directly on the command line or include it in a script. The most common use cases for curl are:

1縲．ownloading files from the internet  
2縲・ndpoint testing  
3縲．ebugging  
4縲・rror logging  

# curl Syntax
The basic curl syntax is as follows:
```
curl [options/URLs]
```
For example:
```
curl https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu.html
```
If you specify a URL that leads to a file, you can use curl to download the file to your local system:
```
curl [url] > [local-file]
```
The syntax of URLs that are part of the command depends on the protocol. Multiple URLs that differ in one part are written together using braces:
```
http://example.{first,second,third}.com
```
Alphanumeric series are written with brackets:
```
ftp://ftp.url.com/file[1-100].txt
```
While nested sequences are not supported, multiple sequences are allowed:
```
http://url.com/archive[2010-2020]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html
```
# curl Protocols
