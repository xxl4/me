Shanghai 2024 10 13 rain, The weather is very bad today, but today i need to go to work outside. I am very tried, but i have to work hard to make money. I hope that the weather will be better tomorrow.

Today i go to the beach to see the sea, Because our work place is near the sea. I like the sea, it is very beautiful. 

When i finish my work, i go home and found that my wife and my son are not at home, I think they go to the park to play the skateboard. I am very happy to see them happy.

My wife make a beautiful video for my son, and send it to me. I am so happy to see it. and i share it to my family. and let them see it. I hope that my son can grow up healthy and happy.

But my son had sick three days ago. and my wife buy a lot of cold drink for him. I am very angry, because the cold drink is not good for the children. I told my wife, but she didn't care about it. 

She always say that i am a Idiot, and don't help my son do nothing. I am so sad, but i can't do anything. I can only work hard and make money to support my family.

In china, when a husband can't eran money, his wife will leave him. and his children and his family will borken. When you need money, you can't do anything. You can only work hard and make money.

Because money is very important in china. If you don't have money, you can't do anything. You can only work hard and make money. I hope that my dreams can come true one day. I will work hard and never give up. I believe that everything will be better.

Maybe not only in china, but also in the world. Money is very important. If you don't have money, you can't do anything. When you have sick, you need money to see a doctor.

When i am a child, my family is very poor. and my mother is unhealthy. So when i face the sick, I am very afraid. I hope that my family can be healthy and happy. I will work hard and make money to support my family.
