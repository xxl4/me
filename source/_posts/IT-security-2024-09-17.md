## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as keyless entry, is an automotive system that allows a driver to lock and unlock their vehicle without having to use a physical key. This system works by using a key fob that emits a signal to the vehicle's receiver. When the key fob is within a certain range of the vehicle, the receiver will send a signal to the door locks, unlocking them. The driver can then enter the vehicle and start it without having to insert a key.

PKE systems are becoming increasingly common on new vehicles. They offer a number of advantages over traditional key-based systems, including:

* **Convenience:** PKE systems are much more convenient than traditional key-based systems. Drivers do not have to fumble for their keys or worry about inserting them into the lock.
* **Security:** PKE systems are more secure than traditional key-based systems. The key fobs used in PKE systems are typically encrypted, making it difficult for thieves to duplicate them.
* **Hands-free operation:** PKE systems allow drivers to lock and unlock their vehicles without having to take their keys out of their pockets or purses. This is especially convenient when carrying groceries or other items.

There are a few disadvantages to PKE systems as well. These disadvantages include:

* **Cost:** PKE systems are more expensive than traditional key-based systems.
* **Battery life:** The key fobs used in PKE systems require batteries. If the battery dies, the key fob will not be able to send a signal to the vehicle's receiver, preventing the driver from locking or unlocking the vehicle.
* **Range:** PKE systems have a limited range. If the driver is too far away from the vehicle, the key fob will not be able to send a signal to the receiver.

Darktrace has appointed Gordon McKenna, the company's current Chief Revenue Officer, as its new CEO. McKenna has been with Darktrace for over 7 years and has played a key role in the company's growth and success.

Gustafsson will remain as a special advisor to the company for a period of time to ensure a smooth transition.

**Market Reaction:**

Darktrace shares initially fell by around 10% on the news of Gustafsson's departure but have since recovered some of those losses. Investors may be concerned about the potential impact of losing such a high-profile and successful CEO.

**Analysis:**

Poppy Gustafsson's departure from Darktrace marks the end of an era for the company. She has been instrumental in its success and growth, and her absence will undoubtedly be felt. However, Darktrace has a strong team in place, and under Gordon McKenna's leadership, the company is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory.

**NCSC and Allies Condemn Russia's Unit 29155 for Cyberattacks**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and its international partners have jointly attributed a series of high-profile cyberattacks to Russia's Unit 29155, also known as the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU).

**Overview of Unit 29155**

Unit 29155 is a military intelligence unit within the GRU, responsible for conducting cyber espionage and disruptive operations worldwide. It is believed to have been involved in numerous cyberattacks against political, economic, and military targets in recent years.

**Attribution of Cyberattacks**

The NCSC and its allies have attributed the following cyberattacks to Unit 29155:

* **DDoS attacks against Ukrainian government websites in 2015**
* **Hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) servers in 2016**
* **Cyberattacks on Estonia's e-government systems in 2017**
* **Attempts to hack into the UK's National Grid in 2018**
* **Cyberattacks on German political parties in 2019**

**Condemnation by International Community**

The NCSC and its allies have strongly condemned Unit 29155's activities, calling them "reckless and irresponsible." They have warned that these cyberattacks threaten national security, economic stability, and democratic processes.

**Response by Russia**

Russia has denied involvement in the cyberattacks attributed to Unit 29155. However, the evidence presented by the NCSC and its allies suggests that the Russian government is responsible.

**Impact of Cyber Warfare**

Cyber warfare has become an increasingly important threat to nations around the world. Cyberattacks can disrupt critical infrastructure, steal sensitive information, and spread disinformation. The attribution of these attacks to Unit 29155 serves as a reminder of the dangers posed by state-sponsored cyberattacks.

**Measures to Combat Cyber Threats**

The NCSC and its allies are working together to combat cyber threats, including:

* Enhancing cyber defense capabilities
* Sharing threat intelligence
* Developing international norms for responsible behavior in cyberspace
* Engaging with governments around the world to address cybercrime and cyber espionage

By taking these measures, the international community can work to protect itself from the growing threat of cyber warfare.

## Fog ransomware crew evolving into wide-ranging threat

**Fog Ransomware Gang Expanding Capabilities, Targeting Critical Infrastructure**

The Fog ransomware gang, known for its targeted attacks on healthcare organizations, has been evolving into a more sophisticated and wide-ranging threat actor. Recent reports indicate that the group is now targeting critical infrastructure, including energy, transportation, and manufacturing sectors.

**Evolution of Tactics**

Fog's ransomware attacks have become more sophisticated in recent months. The group is now employing double-extortion tactics, where they not only encrypt victims' data but also threaten to leak sensitive information unless a ransom is paid. They have also been using custom-made tools to exploit vulnerabilities in targeted systems, bypassing traditional security measures.

**Targeting Critical Infrastructure**

Fog has recently shifted its focus from healthcare organizations to critical infrastructure targets. This change in strategy is a significant concern as attacks on these sectors could have devastating consequences for society. The group has reportedly targeted energy companies, transportation networks, and manufacturing plants in multiple countries.

**Demands Escalating**

The ransom demands made by Fog are also increasing. In some cases, the group has demanded payments exceeding several million dollars. This has put a significant financial burden on victims and made it more difficult for them to recover from the attacks.

**Law Enforcement Response**

Law enforcement agencies around the world are actively investigating Fog ransomware attacks. However, the group's use of sophisticated techniques and its operation across borders has made it challenging to apprehend the individuals responsible.

**Best Practices for Protection**

Organizations can take several steps to protect themselves from Fog ransomware attacks:

* Implement robust security measures, including firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems.
* Regularly update software and patch vulnerabilities.
* Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all critical systems.
* Back up data regularly and store it offline or in a cloud-based location.
* Conduct regular cybersecurity awareness training for employees.

**Conclusion**

The Fog ransomware gang is evolving into a major threat to critical infrastructure. Their sophisticated tactics and escalating ransom demands pose a significant risk. Organizations must be vigilant in implementing strong security measures and educating their employees to mitigate the impact of these attacks. Law enforcement agencies need to continue their efforts to disrupt the group and hold its members accountable.

**London's Dial-a-Ride service has been taken out of action by an ongoing cyber attack on Transport for London (TfL).**

The attack, which began on Friday, has also caused disruption to other TfL services, including the Oyster card system and the TfL website.

Dial-a-Ride is a door-to-door transport service for people with disabilities who are unable to use public transport. The service is currently suspended until further notice.

TfL has said that it is working to restore services as soon as possible. In the meantime, it is advising passengers to use alternative forms of transport.

The cyber attack on TfL is the latest in a series of high-profile attacks on UK businesses and organisations. In recent months, the National Health Service, Royal Mail and British Airways have all been targeted by cyber criminals.

The attacks have raised concerns about the resilience of the UK's critical infrastructure to cyber threats. The government has said that it is committed to investing in cyber security and protecting the UK from future attacks.

**Here is some advice from TfL on what to do if you are affected by the cyber attack:**

* If you are unable to use Dial-a-Ride, please use alternative forms of transport.
* Check the TfL website for updates on the status of services.
* Follow TfL on social media for the latest information.
* If you have any questions, please contact TfL customer services.

## Canadian arrested by France after cooperating with US on Sky ECC cryptophone investigation

Published: Thu, 05 Sep 2024 05:37:00 GMT

**A Canadian man was arrested in France after cooperating with a US investigation into the encrypted phone company Sky ECC.**

Vincent Ramos, 44, was apprehended on January 10 and charged with "complicity in organized crime offenses, conspiracy, and computer fraud," according to a statement from the French Ministry of Justice.

**Ramos is accused of helping Sky ECC users launder money that was used to finance drug trafficking and other criminal activities.**

Sky ECC is a Canadian-based encrypted communications provider that was popular with organized crime groups because it offered a high level of security and anonymity.

In 2021, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it had cracked Sky ECC's encryption and seized millions of messages that had been sent by its users.

The DOJ's investigation led to the arrest of dozens of people around the world, including Ramos.

**Ramos's arrest is a significant development in the investigation into Sky ECC and its role in organized crime.**

It is also a sign of the increasing cooperation between law enforcement agencies around the world in combatting cybercrime.

**The investigation into Sky ECC is ongoing, and it is likely that more arrests will be made in the future.**
