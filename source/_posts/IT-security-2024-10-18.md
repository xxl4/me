**Ransomware Takedowns Didn’t Put Off Cyber Criminals**

Secureworks, a cybersecurity company, has released a report indicating that despite recent successful takedowns of major ransomware operations, cybercriminals remain undeterred in their activities.

**Key Findings:**

* **Increase in Ransomware Attacks:** The number of ransomware attacks tracked by Secureworks has increased by 28% in the past year.
* **Evolution of Tactics:** Cybercriminals are constantly adapting their tactics to evade detection and improve their effectiveness.
* **New Threats Emerge:** New ransomware variants and strains are being developed regularly, posing a continuous threat to organizations.
* **Continued Financial Motive:** Despite the disruption caused by takedowns, ransomware remains a highly lucrative business for cybercriminals.

**Reasons for Continued Activity:**

* **Profitability:** Ransomware attacks offer a high potential for financial gain, driving cybercriminals to continue their activities.
* **Technological Advancements:** Innovations in malware and encryption techniques make it easier for cybercriminals to inflict significant damage.
* **Expanding Target Base:** Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting a wider range of organizations, including small businesses and government entities.
* **Lack of Deterrent:** The consequences for cybercriminals remain relatively low, with few significant legal or financial penalties.

**Implications:**

* Organizations need to be vigilant and continuously update their security measures to protect against ransomware attacks.
* Law enforcement and governments must prioritize efforts to disrupt ransomware operations and bring criminals to justice.
* International cooperation is essential to address the global nature of cybercrime and ransomware threats.

Secureworks emphasizes that ransomware is an ongoing threat that requires a collaborative approach to combat effectively.

**UK's Cyber Incident Reporting Law to Move Forward in 2025**

The United Kingdom is set to implement a new law in 2025 that will require organizations to report significant cyber incidents to the government.

**Key Provisions of the Law:**

* Organizations that experience a "material cyber incident" must report it to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) within 72 hours.
* Material cyber incidents are defined as those that have a significant impact on the organization's operations, finances, or reputation.
* The NCSC will assess the reported incidents and may take appropriate action, such as providing guidance or coordinating response efforts.

**Purpose of the Law:**

* To improve the UK's cybersecurity posture by providing the government with a comprehensive view of cyber threats and incidents.
* To enable the government to better support organizations in their incident response efforts.
* To deter cybercriminals by increasing the risk of detection and consequences.

**Implementation Timeline:**

* The law was originally introduced in 2022 and is expected to be implemented in 2025.
* Organizations will have time to prepare for the new reporting requirements.

**Significance of the Law:**

* The law represents a significant step forward in the UK's cybersecurity strategy.
* It will help to strengthen the UK's resilience against cyber threats.
* It aligns with similar reporting requirements implemented in other countries.

**Impact on Organizations:**

* Organizations must be aware of the new reporting requirements and prepare their incident response plans accordingly.
* They should ensure that they have the necessary systems and processes in place to identify, assess, and report material cyber incidents.
* Failing to report a significant cyber incident within the required timeframe may result in penalties.

The implementation of the cyber incident reporting law in the UK is a positive step towards enhancing cybersecurity and protecting organizations against cyber threats.

Published: Fri, 04 Oct 2024 11:52:00 GMT

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is celebrating eight years of protecting the UK from cyber threats, as the country faces a "regular onslaught" of hostile activity.

The NCSC was established in October 2016 as part of GCHQ to provide a single point of contact for organisations and individuals seeking advice and support on cyber security.

In the past year, the NCSC has responded to over 2,200 cyber incidents, including attacks on critical national infrastructure, businesses, and individuals. It has also provided advice and support to over 100,000 organisations.

The NCSC's work has helped to protect the UK from a number of significant cyber threats, including the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017, the NotPetya attack in 2018, and the SolarWinds attack in 2020.

However, the NCSC warns that the UK continues to face a "regular onslaught" of hostile cyber activity. In the past year, there has been a 15% increase in the number of reported cyber incidents.

The NCSC's director-general, Lindy Cameron, said: "The NCSC has come a long way in eight years. We have established ourselves as a world-leading cyber security organisation, and we have made a significant contribution to protecting the UK from cyber threats.

"However, we know that the threat landscape is constantly evolving. We must continue to adapt and innovate if we are to stay ahead of our adversaries."

The NCSC is working with the government, industry, and academia to develop new ways to protect the UK from cyber threats. This includes investing in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, and working to improve the cyber security skills of the UK workforce.

The NCSC is also working with international partners to share information and best practices on cyber security. This includes working with the US, NATO, and the EU.

The NCSC's work is vital to protecting the UK from cyber threats. The organisation is playing a key role in keeping the UK safe online.
