Today is a rainy day. I went to the office and worked on the project. I have so many things to do.

Today I want to start my first online english class in EF. I have a new teacher that I need to meet her for the first time. I am a little bit nervous because I don't know how to speak english. I hope I can learn more from her.

The teacher is very nice. She is very patient and she speaks very slowly. I can understand her. I am very happy to meet her online. I hope I can learn more from her in the future.

Through the class, I learned a lot of new words and phrases. I also know how to use them in the sentences. I am found myself that I can speak english more fluently than before. and I need to practice more.
