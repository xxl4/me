## What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/two-factor-authentication)

Published: Mon, 28 Oct 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to your online accounts. When you enable 2FA, you're required to provide two forms of authentication when you log in to your account, such as a password and a security code sent to your phone. This makes it much more difficult for someone to access your account, even if they have your password.

Here's how 2FA works:

1. When you log in to your account, you'll be asked to enter your password as usual.
2. Once you've entered your password, you'll be asked to provide a second form of authentication. This can be a security code sent to your phone, a code generated by a mobile app, or a physical security key.
3. Once you've provided the second form of authentication, you'll be able to access your account.

2FA is a simple and effective way to protect your online accounts. It's a good idea to enable 2FA for any account that contains sensitive information, such as your email, bank account, or social media profiles.

**NCSC Expands School Cyber Service to Academies and Private Schools**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has broadened its school cyber support program to encompass academies and private schools. This move aims to bolster the cybersecurity posture of a wider range of educational institutions against the evolving threats of the digital age.

The NCSC's Active Cyber Defence (ACD) service provides schools with ongoing protection and support against cyberattacks. It monitors school networks for suspicious activity, alerts staff to potential threats, and offers guidance on how to mitigate risks. The service also includes access to training materials and resources to enhance staff and students' cybersecurity awareness.

By extending the ACD service to academies and private schools, the NCSC seeks to close a gap in protection for these institutions. Previously, only state-funded schools had access to the service. However, academies and private schools face similar cyber risks and require robust defenses to protect their networks and data.

The NCSC's decision to expand the ACD service is part of its broader efforts to enhance the UK's overall cybersecurity posture. By providing support to schools, the NCSC aims to equip future generations with the knowledge and skills to navigate the challenges posed by cyber threats.

Sarah Lyons, NCSC's Head of Education and Outreach, said: "We are delighted to be able to extend our ACD service to encompass academies and private schools. By providing these institutions with access to the same robust protection and support as state-funded schools, we are helping to ensure that all our young people are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to stay safe online."

NCSC encourages eligible academies and private schools to register for the ACD service. By joining the program, schools can significantly enhance their cybersecurity defenses and create a safer online environment for their students and staff.
