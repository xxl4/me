* An executive order has been issued, giving TikTok 90 days to sell its US operations to an American company or face a ban.

* The deadline for the sale is September 15, 2020, and negotiations are currently underway with potential buyers such as Microsoft and Oracle.

**The Impact:**

* The potential ban of TikTok would have a significant impact on the company, which has over 100 million monthly active users in the US.

* It would also affect millions of creators and influencers who have built their careers on the platform.

* The broader social media landscape could also be altered, as users seek alternatives to TikTok.

**The Future:**

The fate of TikTok in the US remains uncertain. The outcome of the negotiations with potential buyers and the ultimate decision of the Trump administration will determine the future of the app in the country.

Meanwhile, users continue to protest and express their concerns, while the clock ticks down on the September 15 deadline.

## What is password cracking?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/password-cracker)

Published: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 09:00:00 GMT

Password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. Password cracking can be used for legitimate purposes, such as recovering lost passwords or resetting forgotten ones. However, it can also be used for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or unauthorized access to computer systems.

There are a variety of different password cracking techniques. Some of the most common techniques include:

* **Brute force attack:** This technique involves trying every possible password combination until the correct one is found. Brute force attacks can be very time-consuming, but they can be successful if the password is short or simple.
* **Dictionary attack:** This technique involves trying every word in a dictionary as a password. Dictionary attacks can be successful if the password is based on a common word or phrase.
* **Rainbow table attack:** This technique involves using a precomputed table of hashes to try and find the password. Rainbow table attacks can be very fast, but they require a large amount of storage space.
* **Social engineering attack:** This technique involves tricking someone into giving up their password. Social engineering attacks can be very effective, but they require a high level of skill and planning.

Password cracking can be a difficult and time-consuming process. However, there are a number of steps that you can take to protect your passwords from being cracked. These steps include:

* **Use strong passwords:** Your passwords should be at least 12 characters long and should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Don't reuse passwords:** You should never use the same password for multiple accounts. This makes it easier for attackers to gain access to all of your accounts if they crack one of your passwords.
* **Enable two-factor authentication:** Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring you to enter a code from your phone or email in addition to your password. This makes it much more difficult for attackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password.

By following these tips, you can help protect your passwords from being cracked.

**Barings Law Sues Google and Microsoft for £1.5 Billion on Behalf of 15,000 Claimants**

Barings Law, a UK-based law firm specializing in class action lawsuits, has filed a lawsuit against Google and Microsoft, seeking £1.5 billion (approximately $2 billion) in damages on behalf of 15,000 claimants.

**Allegations:**

The lawsuit alleges that Google and Microsoft have violated competition law by abusing their dominant positions in the online advertising market. Barings Law claims that:

* Google and Microsoft have engaged in anti-competitive agreements to exclude rivals.
* They have used their market power to impose unfair terms on advertisers and publishers.
* They have prevented competitors from accessing essential infrastructure and technology.

According to Barings Law, the claimants in the lawsuit have been harmed by the alleged anti-competitive behavior in the following ways:

* Advertisers have been forced to pay higher prices for their campaigns.
* Publishers have received lower revenues from advertising.
* Competitors have been unable to innovate and grow in the online advertising market.

**Damages Claim:**

Barings Law is seeking £100,000 in damages for each claimant, which totals £1.5 billion. The firm believes that the claimants have suffered significant financial losses due to the alleged anti-competitive practices.

**Response from Google and Microsoft:**

Both Google and Microsoft have denied the allegations. Google stated that it "always puts users and advertisers first" and that it "complies fully with competition laws." Microsoft expressed similar sentiments, saying that it "operates in a highly competitive market" and that it "believes in giving customers choice and flexibility."

**Legal Implications:**

If successful, the lawsuit could have significant implications for the online advertising industry. It could result in a substantial fine for Google and Microsoft, as well as changes to their business practices. It could also lead to increased competition and innovation in the market.

**Timeline:**

Barings Law filed the lawsuit on behalf of the claimants in March 2023. The case is currently awaiting a hearing date in the UK courts.
