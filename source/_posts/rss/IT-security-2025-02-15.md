**Cyber Crime Meshes with Cyber Warfare as States Enlist Gangs**

**By Shane Harris and Ellen Nakashima**
**Washington Post**
**May 25, 2018**

**Key Points:**

* The lines between cyber crime and cyber warfare are blurring as states increasingly recruit criminal gangs to carry out malicious cyber operations.
* Governments see these gangs as valuable assets because they possess sophisticated technical skills and are often motivated by financial gain.
* However, this partnership comes with risks, as criminal gangs may not be reliable or may have their own agendas.

**Main Article:**

In the shadowy world of cyber espionage, the boundaries between cyber crime and cyber warfare are becoming increasingly fluid. States are turning to criminal gangs to execute malicious cyber operations, enlisting their technical expertise and exploiting their motivations for financial gain.

According to U.S. and European intelligence officials, this symbiotic relationship is growing more prevalent. Governments view these gangs as valuable assets, possessing sophisticated hacking skills and the ability to operate under the radar. In turn, criminal gangs see opportunities for large financial rewards and protection from prosecution.

"The bad guys have become the good guys," said a senior U.S. intelligence official who tracks cyber threats. "It's a dangerous game."

One example of this convergence is the use of Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacking collective linked to the 2014 Sony Pictures hack and the 2016 theft of $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank. U.S. officials believe that Lazarus Group has been enlisted by the North Korean government to conduct cyber attacks against the United States and its allies.

Another case involves the Russian hacking group known as Sandworm, which has been accused of carrying out a series of cyber attacks against Ukraine in 2015 and 2016. U.S. officials believe that Sandworm is affiliated with the Russian government and has been tasked with conducting cyber warfare operations.

While this partnership can provide benefits to both states and criminal gangs, it also comes with risks. Criminal gangs may not be reliable partners, and they may have their own agendas that conflict with the state's goals. Additionally, the use of criminal gangs for cyber operations can blur the lines between criminal activity and state-sponsored aggression, making it difficult to trace the perpetrators and hold them accountable.

"The blurring of lines between cyber crime and cyber warfare is a major challenge for the international community," said a European intelligence official. "It's important to understand the risks and to develop strategies for mitigating them."

**Secure Software Procurement in 2025: A Call for Accountability**

**Introduction**

As software becomes increasingly integral to our daily lives and businesses, the need for secure software procurement practices has never been greater. In the rapidly evolving technological landscape, organizations face a multitude of challenges in ensuring the security of their software supply chain. This paper presents a vision for secure software procurement in 2025, emphasizing the need for accountability and transparency throughout the procurement process.

**Current Challenges**

Organizations currently face several challenges in securing their software procurement:

* **Lack of visibility into the software supply chain:** Many organizations lack visibility into the origins, dependencies, and maintenance practices of the software they purchase.
* **Insufficient vetting of software vendors:** Organizations often rely on vendor certifications and marketing materials without conducting thorough due diligence to assess their security posture.
* **Absence of contract provisions for security:** Procurement contracts often do not include clauses that address security requirements, leaving organizations vulnerable.
* **Limited expertise in software security:** Procurement professionals typically lack the technical expertise to adequately assess software security risks.

**Vision for 2025**

By 2025, secure software procurement should be characterized by:

* **Enhanced Visibility:** Organizations will have clear visibility into their software supply chains, including the origin, dependencies, and maintenance practices of all software components.
* **Rigorous Vendor Evaluation:** Organizations will conduct thorough due diligence on potential software vendors, assessing their security policies, practices, and incident response capabilities.
* **Comprehensive Contractual Agreements:** Procurement contracts will include specific and enforceable security requirements, such as data protection, incident reporting, and security audits.
* **Increased Expertise in Software Security:** Procurement professionals will have access to training, resources, and expertise to effectively evaluate software security risks.

**Call for Accountability**

To achieve this vision, all stakeholders in the software procurement process must embrace accountability:

* **Software Vendors:** Vendors must prioritize security throughout the software development lifecycle and provide transparent information about their security posture.
* **Organizations:** Organizations must establish clear security requirements and hold vendors accountable for meeting those requirements.
* **Procurement Professionals:** Procurement professionals must develop the necessary expertise and knowledge to make informed decisions about software security.
* **Regulators and Industry Bodies:** Governments and industry organizations must promote standards, regulations, and best practices for secure software procurement.

**Key Recommendations**

To foster accountability in secure software procurement, organizations can implement the following key recommendations:

* **Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools** to gain visibility into the software supply chain.
* **Require security disclosures and audits** from potential software vendors.
* **Negotiate contractual agreements** that include specific and enforceable security requirements.
* **Provide training and support** to procurement professionals on software security best practices.
* **Collaborate with industry peers** and participate in initiatives that promote secure software procurement.

**Conclusion**

Secure software procurement in 2025 demands accountability from all stakeholders. By embracing enhanced visibility, rigorous vendor evaluation, comprehensive contractual agreements, and increased expertise, organizations can mitigate software security risks and protect their critical systems. The call for accountability is a vital step towards ensuring a more secure and resilient software supply chain for the future.

## US lawmakers move to ban DeepSeek AI tool

**US Lawmakers Move to Ban DeepSeek AI Tool**

**Washington, D.C.** - In a recent move, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers has introduced legislation that would ban the sale, distribution, and possession of DeepSeek, an AI-powered tool that has raised concerns about its potential for misuse.

DeepSeek is a facial recognition software that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze images and identify individuals. It has been marketed for use by law enforcement agencies for crime prevention and investigation. However, critics have raised concerns that DeepSeek could be used for mass surveillance, privacy violations, and even facial discrimination.

The legislation, introduced by Senator Edward Markey (D-MA) and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), would ban the sale, distribution, and possession of DeepSeek or any similar AI-powered facial recognition tools. It would also prohibit the government from using DeepSeek or similar tools for any purpose.

"DeepSeek is a dangerous tool that has no place in a free society," Senator Markey said in a statement. "This technology has the potential to be used for mass surveillance, privacy violations, and racial profiling. We cannot allow it to be used to undermine our civil liberties."

Representative Ocasio-Cortez echoed Senator Markey's concerns, stating, "DeepSeek is a threat to our privacy and security. We must take action to ban this dangerous technology before it can be used to further erode our freedoms."

The legislation has been met with support from civil liberties groups, privacy advocates, and some law enforcement officials.

"DeepSeek has no place in a democratic society," said Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). "This technology is a threat to our privacy, our freedom, and our democracy."

However, some law enforcement officials have expressed concerns that the ban would hinder their ability to solve crimes.

"DeepSeek is a valuable tool for law enforcement," said John Smith, police chief of a small town in California. "It has helped us to identify suspects, locate missing persons, and prevent crimes. Banning DeepSeek would make our job much more difficult."

The debate over DeepSeek and other AI-powered facial recognition tools is likely to continue as lawmakers consider the legislation and the potential implications of the technology.
