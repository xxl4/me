[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/video/An-explanation-of-ransomware)

Published: Fri, 08 Nov 2024 13:15:00 GMT

**Ransomware**

**Definition:**

Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files on a victim's computer and demands a ransom payment in exchange for decrypting them. If the victim does not pay the ransom within a specified time frame, the files may be permanently lost.

**How Ransomware Works:**

1. **Infection:** Ransomware typically infiltrates a computer through malicious email attachments, unsafe downloads, or software vulnerabilities.
2. **Encryption:** Once infected, the ransomware scans the computer for valuable files, such as documents, spreadsheets, photos, and videos. It then encrypts these files using a complex algorithm, rendering them inaccessible.
3. **Ransom Demand:** After encrypting the files, the ransomware displays a ransom note on the victim's computer. This note typically includes instructions on how to make the ransom payment, usually via cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.
4. **Time Limit:** Ransomware often sets a time limit for the victim to pay the ransom. If the deadline is missed, the ransom may increase or the files may be permanently deleted.

**Types of Ransomware:**

* **Crypto-ransomware:** Encrypts files using strong encryption algorithms, making it nearly impossible to recover them without the correct decryption key.
* **Locker-ransomware:** Locks the victim out of their computer or blocks access to specific files or applications.
* **Scareware:** Poses as legitimate software but encrypts files and demands a ransom, without actually providing any malware capabilities.

**How to Protect Against Ransomware:**

* **Use Anti-Malware Software:** Install a reputable anti-malware program and keep it updated to detect and block ransomware infections.
* **Back Up Data Regularly:** Back up your important files to an external hard drive or cloud storage service. This will allow you to restore your data if ransomware attacks.
* **Be Cautious of Email Attachments and Downloads:** Avoid opening suspicious email attachments or downloading files from untrusted sources.
* **Update Software:** Keep your operating system and software applications up to date to patch security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by ransomware.
* **Use Two-Factor Authentication:** Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for important accounts to add an extra layer of security.
* **Educate Employees:** Train employees on ransomware risks and best practices to prevent infection.

**What to Do If Infected:**

* **Do Not Pay the Ransom:** Paying the ransom only encourages cybercriminals and does not guarantee that your files will be decrypted.
* **Contact Authorities:** Report the ransomware infection to law enforcement and cybersecurity agencies.
* **Restore Data from Backups:** If possible, restore your files from a backup made before the infection.
* **Remove Malware:** Run a thorough malware scan to remove the ransomware and any other associated malware.

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/two-factor-authentication)

Published: Mon, 28 Oct 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** is a security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to your online accounts. It requires you to provide two separate forms of authentication when logging in:

**1. Something You Know:**
* This is typically a password or PIN that you create and remember.

**2. Something You Have or Are:**
* This could be a physical device like a smartphone, a security key, or a fingerprint scanner.

**How 2FA Works:**

1. When you log in to a protected account, you first enter your password (the "something you know").
2. The service then sends a verification code or push notification to your authorized device (the "something you have or are").
3. You enter the verification code or approve the push notification, which allows you to access your account.

**Benefits of 2FA:**

* **Increased Security:** Even if an attacker obtains your password, they cannot access your account without also having your physical device or biometric information.
* **Reduced Risk of Phishing Attacks:** Phishing attempts to trick you into revealing your password, but 2FA prevents attackers from accessing your account even if you fall victim to these scams.
* **Protection Against Account Takeovers:** 2FA makes it harder for unauthorized users to gain control of your account.

**Types of 2FA Methods:**

* **SMS-based 2FA:** Verification codes are sent via text messages.
* **App-based 2FA:** Verification codes are generated and displayed on a trusted mobile application.
* **Physical Security Keys:** Small USB devices that are inserted into your computer or mobile device for verification.
* **Biometric Verification:** Fingerprint or facial recognition technology.

**Implementation:**

2FA can be enabled for various online accounts, such as email, social media, banking, and financial services. You can usually set up 2FA in the security settings of your account.
