[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366617283/Conservative-MP-adds-to-calls-for-public-enquiry-over-PSNI-police-spying)

Published: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:45:00 GMT

**Conservative MP adds to calls for public inquiry over PSNI police spying**

A Conservative MP has added his voice to calls for a public inquiry into alleged spying by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).

David Davis, who served as Brexit Secretary under Theresa May, said there was "clear evidence" of a "pattern of wrongdoing" by the PSNI.

His comments came after the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland (PONI) published a report that found the PSNI had spied on journalists and politicians.

The PONI report found that the PSNI had collected and retained information on journalists and politicians without their knowledge or consent.

It also found that the PSNI had used covert surveillance techniques to gather information on people who were not suspected of any wrongdoing.

Davis said that the PONI report "raises serious questions about the conduct of the PSNI".

He said that "a public inquiry is now necessary to get to the bottom of what happened and to hold those responsible to account".

The PSNI has denied any wrongdoing and said that it will cooperate fully with any public inquiry.

However, Davis said that the PSNI's denial "is not credible".

He said that "the evidence of wrongdoing is clear" and that "a public inquiry is now necessary to get to the truth".

The call for a public inquiry has been supported by a number of other politicians, including Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald.

McDonald said that the PONI report "has exposed a shocking catalogue of abuses by the PSNI".

She said that "a full, independent public inquiry is now essential to uncover the full extent of this scandal".

The PSNI is facing increasing pressure to hold a public inquiry into the alleged spying.

The Police Ombudsman has called for a public inquiry, and a number of politicians have also expressed their support for one.

It remains to be seen whether the PSNI will agree to hold a public inquiry. However, the pressure is mounting, and it is increasingly likely that one will be held.

## What is PKI (public key infrastructure)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/PKI)

Published: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**

PKI is a system that manages and authenticates the use of public key cryptography for secure electronic communications. It consists of:

**1. Certificate Authority (CA):**

* A trusted third-party that issues digital certificates to verify the identity of entities (e.g., websites, individuals).
* The CA's certificate is the root of trust in the PKI system.

**2. Digital Certificates:**

* Electronic credentials that contain the public key and identity information of the certificate holder.
* Used to establish a secure connection between two parties.

**3. Public Key:**

* A mathematical key used to encrypt data.
* Published and can be used by anyone to encrypt messages.

**4. Private Key:**

* A mathematical key used to decrypt data encrypted with the public key.
* Kept secret by the certificate holder.

**How PKI Works:**

1. **Certificate Request:** An entity (e.g., a website) requests a digital certificate from a CA.
2. **Verification:** The CA verifies the entity's identity through a specified validation process.
3. **Certificate Issuance:** If verified, the CA issues a digital certificate containing the entity's public key, identity, and validity period.
4. **Certificate Distribution:** The certificate is distributed to the entity for use online.
5. **Client-Server Communication:** When a client (e.g., a web browser) connects to a server, the server presents its digital certificate.
6. **Certificate Validation:** The client checks the certificate to verify its authenticity and trust the server.
7. **Secure Channel Establishment:** If the certificate is valid, a secure encrypted channel is established using the public and private keys.

**Benefits of PKI:**

* **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of entities in electronic communications.
* **Confidentiality:** Ensures that data is encrypted and can only be decrypted by authorized parties.
* **Integrity:** Protects data from modification or tampering.
* **Non-repudiation:** Provides evidence that an entity sent or received a message.
* **Enhanced Security:** Allows for secure communication over unsecured networks (e.g., the internet).

**Passwordless Authentication**

Passwordless authentication is a method of accessing online accounts without the need for a traditional password. Instead, it relies on alternative credentials or verification methods to verify user identity.

**Types of Passwordless Authentication:**

**1. Biometric Verification:**
* Fingerprint scan
* Facial recognition
* Voice recognition

**2. One-Time Passwords (OTPs):**
* SMS-based OTPs
* Email-based OTPs
* Time-based OTPs (TOTPs)

**3. Security Keys:**
* Physical tokens
* USB-based
* Bluetooth-based

**4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
* Combines multiple methods of authentication, such as OTPs with biometric verification.

**Benefits of Passwordless Authentication:**

* **Enhanced Security:** Eliminates the risk of password theft or brute-force attacks.
* **Improved User Experience:** No need to remember or reset passwords, making it faster and easier to access accounts.
* **Reduced Fraud:** Lessens the likelihood of unauthorized account access.
* **Compliance:** Meets regulatory requirements that mandate strong authentication.
* **Cost Savings:** Eliminates the need for password management systems and incident response costs.

**How Passwordless Authentication Works:**

1. **User Verification:** The user provides an alternative credential (e.g., fingerprint, OTP) or combination of credentials (MFA).
2. **Authentication:** The authentication server verifies the user's identity based on the provided credentials.
3. **Account Access:** Once verified, the user is granted access to their account without a password.

**Examples of Passwordless Authentication:**

* **Windows Hello:** Uses facial recognition or fingerprint scan for authentication.
* **Apple Touch ID:** Uses fingerprint scan for authentication.
* **Google Smart Lock:** Allows users to sign in to websites and apps using their phone's Bluetooth proximity.
* **Yubico YubiKey:** A physical security key that generates OTPs.

**Considerations for Passwordless Authentication:**

* **Cost of Implementation:** May require hardware upgrades or software changes.
* **Convenience:** Some methods (e.g., biometrics) may be less convenient than passwords for certain users.
* **Security:** While generally more secure than passwords, passwordless authentication methods can still be susceptible to vulnerabilities.
