[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366619170/UK-accused-of-political-foreign-cyberattack-on-US-after-serving-secret-snooping-order-on-Apple)

Published: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 12:54:00 GMT

**Summary**

The United Kingdom has been accused of carrying out a politically motivated "foreign cyber attack" on the United States after the British government secretly demanded Apple provide access to an iPhone belonging to a U.S. citizen, without the knowledge or consent of the U.S. government.

**Background**

In 2015, the U.K. government served a secret snooping order on Apple, demanding that the company assist in unlocking an iPhone belonging to David Miranda, the partner of Edward Snowden. Miranda, a Brazilian citizen, was passing through Heathrow Airport at the time and was detained for nine hours under Schedule 7 of the UK's Terrorism Act.

Apple refused to unlock the phone, arguing that doing so would violate the privacy of its customers and undermine the security of its products. The U.K. government then threatened to fine Apple £75,000 (US$100,000) per day until the company complied.

**Allegations of Political Motivation**

The U.S. government has accused the U.K. of using the snooping order to gather intelligence on Miranda for political purposes, rather than for the purpose of counter-terrorism. The U.S. alleges that the U.K. was motivated by a desire to embarrass the Obama administration, which had been critical of the U.K.'s surveillance practices.

**Denial by U.K.**

The U.K. government has denied the allegations, stating that the snooping order was issued for legitimate counter-terrorism purposes. The U.K. also argues that it had the legal authority to issue the order under the Terrorism Act.

**Implications**

The allegations against the U.K. have raised concerns about the use of foreign cyber attacks for political purposes. The incident has also strained relations between the U.S. and the U.K., which are close allies in the fight against terrorism.

**Resolution**

The dispute between the U.S. and the U.K. over the snooping order remains unresolved. The U.K. has not withdrawn the order, and Apple has not unlocked the iPhone.

**Apple's Response**

Apple has strongly condemned the UK government's request, calling it an "unprecedented attack on our customers' privacy." The company insists that its encryption system is designed to protect user data from unauthorized access, even from Apple itself.

"We believe that people have a fundamental right to privacy, and that includes the right to secure their data from unauthorized access," said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering.

**Industry Concerns**

The UK's demand has sent shockwaves through the tech industry. Other companies, such as Google and Microsoft, have expressed similar concerns about the potential impact on user privacy and data security.

"This type of demand could set a dangerous precedent, where governments can use legal coercion to access private information without a warrant or due process," said a spokesperson for Google.

**Legal and Ethical Implications**

The legality and ethics of backdoor access have been debated for years. Some experts argue that it is a necessary evil to ensure public safety, while others believe that it violates fundamental rights to privacy.

"The government must strike a balance between protecting national security and safeguarding individual freedoms," said Colin Bennett, professor of information security at the University of Southampton.

**International Impact**

The UK's request could have implications beyond its borders. Other countries may follow suit, pressuring tech companies to provide backdoor access to their services. This raises concerns about the potential for data breaches and the erosion of global privacy standards.

**Conclusion**

The UK government's demand for backdoor access to Apple's iCloud has sparked a fierce debate over privacy and data security. The ramifications of this decision will likely be felt by tech companies and users alike for years to come.

## RFI vs. RFP vs. RFQ: How they differ and which is best for you
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/tip/RFI-vs-RFP-vs-RFQ-What-are-the-differences)

Published: Fri, 07 Feb 2025 13:03:00 GMT

**RFI (Request for Information)**

* **Purpose:** Gather information and insights from potential vendors about their capabilities, expertise, and solutions.
* **Format:** Typically an open-ended questionnaire or interview.
* **Timeline:** Usually the shortest of the three types, as it involves only information gathering.

**RFP (Request for Proposal)**

* **Purpose:** Request formal proposals from vendors that outline their detailed plans, pricing, and timelines for meeting the buyer's specific requirements.
* **Format:** Structured and comprehensive document that includes detailed specifications, evaluation criteria, and submission instructions.
* **Timeline:** Longer than RFI, as it involves a thorough evaluation of proposals and negotiations.

**RFQ (Request for Quotation)**

* **Purpose:** Request specific pricing and availability for a well-defined product or service.
* **Format:** Simple and focused, typically requesting specific quotes based on defined requirements.
* **Timeline:** Shortest of the three types, as it involves only price inquiries.

**How to Choose the Right Type**

The choice between RFI, RFP, and RFQ depends on the specific procurement needs:

* **RFI:** Best for gathering general information, exploring market options, and narrowing down potential vendors.
* **RFP:** Best for complex projects or services that require detailed proposals and negotiations.
* **RFQ:** Best for purchasing well-defined products or services where price is the primary factor.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Scope and Complexity:** RFPs are typically used for projects with greater scope and complexity, while RFQs are suitable for simple purchases.
* **Evaluation Criteria:** RFPs emphasize the evaluation of vendor capabilities and solutions, while RFQs focus solely on price.
* **Competition:** RFIs and RFPs encourage competition by soliciting multiple proposals, while RFQs can be used to obtain competitive quotes from a limited number of vendors.
* **Timeframe:** RFIs have the shortest timeframe, followed by RFQs and then RFPs.
* **Budget:** RFIs and RFQs are typically less costly to issue than RFPs due to their simpler nature.

**Best Practices:**

* Clearly define the procurement objectives and scope.
* Craft well-written documents that provide clear instructions and expectations.
* Set realistic timelines and allow ample time for vendor responses.
* Evaluate responses objectively and consistently based on predefined criteria.
* Communicate clearly with vendors throughout the procurement process.
