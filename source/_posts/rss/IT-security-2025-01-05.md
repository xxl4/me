## What is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/Gramm-Leach-Bliley-Act)

Published: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 13:49:00 GMT

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is a federal law that was enacted in 1999 in response to the consolidation of the financial services industry. The law is designed to protect consumers' financial information by requiring financial institutions to take steps to safeguard this information and to provide consumers with access to their information.

The GLBA has three main components:

* **The Financial Services Modernization Act:** This component of the law repealed the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which had prohibited banks from engaging in certain types of financial activities, such as underwriting securities. The repeal of Glass-Steagall allowed banks to consolidate with other types of financial institutions, such as brokerage firms and insurance companies.
* **The Privacy of Consumer Financial Information Act (PCFIA):** This component of the law requires financial institutions to provide consumers with notice of their privacy policies and to obtain consumers' opt-in consent before sharing their personal information with third parties.
* **The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA):** This component of the law regulates the credit industry and protects consumers' access to accurate and complete credit information. The FCRA requires credit reporting agencies to provide consumers with free copies of their credit reports and to investigate any disputes about the accuracy of their reports.

The GLBA has been amended several times since it was enacted in 1999. In 2005, the GLBA was amended by the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA), which strengthened the FCRA's identity theft provisions. In 2010, the GLBA was amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB is responsible for enforcing the GLBA and other consumer financial protection laws.

## What is a public key and how does it work?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key)

Published: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Public Key**

A public key is a cryptographic key that is made publicly available and is used to encrypt messages or data. It is part of a pair of keys, the other being a private key, which is kept secret.

**How a Public Key Works**

1. **Key Generation:** A pair of public and private keys is generated using a cryptographic algorithm. The public key is freely shared with others, while the private key is kept strictly confidential.

2. **Encryption:** When a sender wants to send a secure message to a recipient, they use the recipient's public key to encrypt the message. The public key is used to transform the message into ciphertext that cannot be read by anyone who does not have the corresponding private key.

3. **Decryption:** The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the ciphertext. The private key is the only key that can successfully decrypt the message that was encrypted with the corresponding public key.

4. **Verification:** Public keys can also be used to verify digital signatures. A digital signature is a cryptographic hash of a message that is encrypted with the sender's private key. The public key can be used to verify the signature and ensure that the message has not been tampered with.

**Advantages of Public Key Cryptography**

* **Secure Communication:** Public key cryptography allows for secure communication even if the communication channel is insecure.
* **Non-Repudiation:** Digital signatures provide non-repudiation, ensuring that the sender cannot deny sending the message.
* **Flexibility:** Public keys can be used for a variety of applications, including encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and key exchange.

**Applications of Public Key Cryptography**

* Secure email (PGP, S/MIME)
* Secure web browsing (HTTPS)
* Digital signatures
* Blockchain technology
* Cryptocurrency wallets

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/proxy-firewall)

Published: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Proxy Firewall**

A proxy firewall is a type of firewall that acts as an intermediary between clients (e.g., computers) and external networks (e.g., the Internet). It routes all traffic through a single point, enabling the firewall to monitor and control access to the external network.

**How it Works:**

1. **Client Connection:** The client establishes a connection to the proxy server, using a protocol such as HTTP or HTTPS.
2. **Traffic Interception:** The proxy server intercepts the traffic from the client and forwards it to the external network.
3. **Filter and Analysis:** The proxy firewall analyzes and filters the traffic based on preconfigured rules and policies.
4. **Response Forwarding:** If the traffic is allowed by the rules, the proxy firewall forwards the response from the external network back to the client.

**Advantages:**

* **Centralized Control:** All traffic passes through a single point, making it easier to monitor and manage security.
* **Enhanced Security:** The proxy firewall can filter out malicious traffic and prevent unauthorized access.
* **Anonymity:** Proxy servers can mask the client's IP address, providing some level of anonymity.
* **Content Filtering:** Proxy firewalls can be configured to block or allow access to specific websites or content.
* **Bandwidth Management:** Proxy servers can optimize traffic flow and reduce bandwidth usage.

**Limitations:**

* **Performance Overhead:** Adding a proxy layer can introduce some performance latency, especially for large or high-volume traffic.
* **Configuration Complexity:** Configuring and maintaining a proxy firewall can be complex and require specialized expertise.
* **Dependency on Trust:** The proxy server acts as a trusted intermediary, so its security is critical.
* **Limited Functionality:** Proxy firewalls may not be suitable for all types of network environments, such as those requiring direct port access.

**Applications:**

Proxy firewalls are commonly used in:

* Corporate networks to protect internal resources from external threats.
* Internet service providers (ISPs) to provide security and content filtering services to customers.
* Web servers to enhance performance and security.
* Home networks to provide basic security and parental control.

**Latest Attempt to Override UK’s Outdated Hacking Law Stalls**

The long-awaited reform of the UK's outdated hacking law has hit another roadblock. The government has announced that the previously scheduled committee stage of the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill has been postponed indefinitely.

**The Outdated Hacking Law**

The current hacking law, the Computer Misuse Act (CMA), was enacted in 1990, an era when technology was vastly different from today. It criminalizes unauthorized access to computer systems and data, but it has been criticized as ineffective and overly broad.

**The Proposed Reform**

The Data Protection and Digital Information Bill aims to modernize the CMA by introducing a new offense of "unauthorized access to a computer." This offense would focus on the intent of the hacker rather than the technicalities of their actions, and it would provide clearer guidance to law enforcement and the judiciary.

**The Stalled Bill**

The government's decision to postpone the committee stage of the bill is a setback for privacy advocates and cybersecurity experts. The committee stage is where the bill would have been scrutinized and amended by Parliament.

**Reasons for the Delay**

The government has not provided a specific reason for the delay, but it is believed that the postponement is due to a combination of factors, including:

* A desire to consult further with stakeholders
* Concerns about the bill's potential impact on law enforcement
* Political priorities shifting due to the ongoing economic and political turmoil

**Reaction to the Delay**

Privacy advocates have expressed disappointment at the delay. Elizabeth Denham, the UK Information Commissioner, said that "the CMA is no longer fit for purpose, and the delay in reforming it is a blow to consumers and businesses alike."

Law enforcement agencies have also expressed concerns. The National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) has argued that the bill's focus on intent could make it more difficult to prosecute hackers.

**Next Steps**

It is unclear when the government will reschedule the committee stage of the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill. The bill is still expected to be passed into law eventually, but the delay will likely extend its timeline and potentially water down its provisions.

**Conclusion**

The postponement of the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill is a reminder of the challenges involved in modernizing the UK's laws in the face of rapidly evolving technology. The outcome of this bill will have a significant impact on data privacy, cybersecurity, and the ability of law enforcement to respond to cybercrime.

**Conservative MP adds to calls for public inquiry over PSNI police spying**

A Conservative MP has added to calls for a public inquiry into allegations that members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) spied on political opponents.

Andrew Rosindell, MP for Romford, said that the allegations were "extremely serious" and that "the public deserve to know the truth."

His comments come after a number of former PSNI officers alleged that they were ordered to spy on politicians and others who were opposed to the British government's policies in Northern Ireland.

The allegations have been made in a series of articles in the Sunday Times newspaper.

The PSNI has denied the allegations, but the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has launched an investigation.

The IPCC is a body that investigates complaints against the police in England and Wales. It has no jurisdiction in Northern Ireland, but it has been asked by the PSNI to investigate the allegations.

The IPCC has said that it will "thoroughly investigate" the allegations and will "follow the evidence wherever it leads."

**Calls for a public inquiry**

A number of people have called for a public inquiry into the allegations.

The Sinn Féin party, the main nationalist party in Northern Ireland, has said that a public inquiry is "essential" to restore public confidence in the PSNI.

The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the other main nationalist party in Northern Ireland, has also called for a public inquiry.

The Alliance Party, a cross-community party in Northern Ireland, has said that it "supports the call for a public inquiry into these allegations."

**The PSNI's response**

The PSNI has denied the allegations and has said that it is cooperating with the IPCC's investigation.

The PSNI has also said that it is committed to "upholding the highest standards of policing and integrity."

**The IPCC's investigation**

The IPCC has said that it will "thoroughly investigate" the allegations and will "follow the evidence wherever it leads."

The IPCC has not said when it expects to complete its investigation.

**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**

PKI is a system that provides a secure and trusted framework for managing and distributing digital certificates. It enables organizations to establish secure digital identities for individuals, devices, and other entities.

**Components of PKI:**

* **Certification Authority (CA):** A trusted entity that issues digital certificates.
* **Registration Authority (RA):** A service that verifies the identity of certificate applicants.
* **Certificate Store:** A repository that stores digital certificates.
* **Certificate Revocation List (CRL):** A list of certificates that have been revoked or expired.
* **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):** A protocol that allows real-time validation of certificate status.

**Process of Obtaining a Digital Certificate:**

1. Identify the need for a digital certificate.
2. Submit a request to a trusted CA through an RA.
3. Provide required identification documents for verification.
4. The CA verifies the applicant's identity and generates a digital certificate.
5. The certificate is stored in a secure certificate store.

**PKI Benefits:**

* **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of individuals and entities.
* **Encryption:** Secures communication by encrypting data.
* **Non-repudiation:** Prevents parties from denying their involvement in a transaction.
* **Integrity:** Ensures that data has not been tampered with.
* **Trust:** Provides confidence in the validity of digital identities.

**PKI Applications:**

* Secure websites (HTTPS)
* Electronic signatures
* Code signing
* Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
* Email encryption
* IoT device authentication

## What is passwordless authentication?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/passwordless-authentication)

Published: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Passwordless authentication is a method of authentication that does not require a user to enter a password. Instead, it relies on other factors to verify the user's identity, such as a PIN, biometric data (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition), or a one-time code sent via SMS or email.

Passwordless authentication is considered more secure than traditional password-based authentication, as it is more difficult for attackers to compromise a user's account. This is because passwords can be easily stolen or guessed, while other factors used in passwordless authentication are more difficult to obtain.

Additionally, passwordless authentication is more convenient for users, as they do not have to remember multiple passwords. This can lead to increased productivity and satisfaction.

Here are some of the benefits of passwordless authentication:

* Increased security: Passwordless authentication is more difficult for attackers to compromise a user's account.
* Improved convenience: Passwordless authentication is more convenient for users, as they do not have to remember multiple passwords.
* Enhanced privacy: Passwordless authentication can help to protect user privacy, as it does not require users to share their passwords with anyone.

Here are some of the challenges of passwordless authentication:

* Cost: Implementing passwordless authentication can be more expensive than traditional password-based authentication.
* Compatibility: Passwordless authentication may not be compatible with all devices and applications.
* Usability: Passwordless authentication may not be as easy to use as traditional password-based authentication.

Overall, passwordless authentication is a more secure and convenient method of authentication than traditional password-based authentication. However, there are some challenges that need to be addressed before it can be widely adopted.
