Published: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**What is a Public Key?**

A public key is a cryptographic key that is used in public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric encryption. It is one of a pair of mathematically related keys, the other being a private key.

**How a Public Key Works:**

Public-key cryptography is based on mathematical algorithms that involve complex mathematical functions and number theory. The public key works in conjunction with the private key to secure communications and data in the following way:

1. **Key Generation:**
   - A pair of keys (public and private) are generated using a cryptographic algorithm. The keys are mathematically linked, but the private key cannot be derived from the public key.

2. **Encryption:**
   - The public key is made publicly available.
   - The message or data to be secured is encrypted using the recipient's public key.
   - The encrypted message can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key.

3. **Decryption:**
   - The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the encrypted message.
   - The decryption operation reverses the encryption process, revealing the original plaintext message.

4. **Authentication:**
   - Public keys can also be used for authentication.
   - A message or signature is digitally signed using the private key.
   - The recipient can verify the authenticity of the message by using the corresponding public key to validate the signature.

**Key Features of Public Key Cryptography:**

* **Data Privacy:** Only the intended recipient (with the private key) can decrypt the encrypted data.
* **Authentication:** Public keys can verify the authenticity of messages and signatures.
* **Non-Repudiation:** The recipient cannot deny that they received the message, as it has been authenticated using their public key.
* **Key Distribution:** Public keys can be shared openly without compromising the security of the private key.

**Applications of Public Keys:**

Public keys are widely used in various applications, including:

* Secure email (e.g., PGP, S/MIME)
* Encrypted web browsing (HTTPS)
* Digital signatures
* Authentication mechanisms
* Blockchains and cryptocurrencies

**Latest attempt to override UK’s outdated hacking law stalls**

The UK government's latest attempt to override its outdated hacking law has stalled, leaving campaigners disappointed.

The Law Commission, an independent body that advises the government on legal reform, has published a report on the Computer Misuse Act 1990 (CMA). The report recommends a number of changes to the law, including:

* Clarifying the definition of "unauthorized access" to computer systems
* Creating a new offense of "reckless hacking"
* Increasing the maximum penalty for hacking offenses

The government had been expected to introduce a bill to implement the Law Commission's recommendations by the end of the year. However, it is now unclear when or if the bill will be introduced.

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said: "We are considering the Law Commission's report and will respond in due course."

Campaigners have expressed disappointment at the delay. Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group, said: "The government has been promising to update the CMA for years. It is now clear that they have no intention of doing so."

"The CMA is outdated and does not reflect the way that computers are used today. It is essential that the government takes action to update the law and protect people from hacking."

The CMA was introduced in 1990, before the internet became widely used. The law has been criticized for being too vague and for failing to keep pace with technological developments.

In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile hacking cases that have highlighted the need for a new law. In 2014, hackers stole the personal data of millions of customers from TalkTalk. In 2017, the NHS was hit by a ransomware attack that caused widespread disruption.

**Conservative MP adds to calls for public inquiry over PSNI police spying**

A Conservative MP has added to calls for a public inquiry into allegations that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) spied on journalists and politicians.

Sir Bernard Jenkin, the chairman of the House of Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, said in a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel that the allegations were "extremely serious" and that a public inquiry was needed to "get to the truth of the matter."

The allegations have been made by former PSNI officers and journalists. They claim that the PSNI used covert surveillance techniques to gather information on journalists and politicians, including their private lives and political activity.

The PSNI has denied the allegations, but Sir Bernard said that the public needed to be "reassured that the police are not abusing their powers."

He said: "The allegations that the PSNI has been spying on journalists and politicians are extremely serious. They go to the heart of our democracy and the rule of law.

"The public needs to be reassured that the police are not abusing their powers and that they are accountable to the public for their actions.

"A public inquiry is the best way to get to the truth of the matter. It would be independent, impartial and would allow all the evidence to be heard.

"I urge the Home Secretary to consider my request and to agree to a public inquiry."

The call for a public inquiry has also been backed by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ).

The NUJ's general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: "The allegations that the PSNI has been spying on journalists are deeply troubling.

"Journalists play a vital role in a democratic society and they must be able to work without fear of being targeted by the police.

"We support the calls for a public inquiry into these allegations. It is essential that the truth is established and that those responsible are held to account."

## What is passwordless authentication?

Published: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Passwordless authentication is a method of verifying user identity without using a traditional password. Instead, it relies on other factors, such as a one-time code sent to a mobile device, a fingerprint scan, or facial recognition.

**Benefits of passwordless authentication:**

* **Increased security:** Passwords can be easily stolen or hacked, but passwordless authentication methods are more difficult to compromise.
* **Improved user experience:** Passwordless authentication is more convenient and easier to use than traditional passwords. Users don't have to remember complex passwords or worry about forgetting them.
* **Reduced risk of fraud:** Passwordless authentication can help to reduce the risk of fraud by making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access accounts.

**How passwordless authentication works:**

There are a number of different passwordless authentication methods, but they all share some common features. Typically, passwordless authentication involves:

1. **Registering your device or account:** You will need to register your device or account with the service you want to use. This may involve providing a phone number, email address, or other identifying information.
2. **Verifying your identity:** When you log in to the service, you will be asked to verify your identity. This may involve entering a one-time code sent to your mobile device, scanning your fingerprint, or using facial recognition.
3. **Granting access:** Once your identity has been verified, you will be granted access to the service.

**Examples of passwordless authentication methods:**

* **One-time passwords (OTPs):** OTPs are short, one-time codes that are sent to your mobile device. You can use an OTP to log in to your account, even if you don't have your password.
* **Fingerprint scanning:** Fingerprint scanning is a biometric authentication method that uses the unique patterns on your fingerprints to identify you.
* **Facial recognition:** Facial recognition is a biometric authentication method that uses the unique features of your face to identify you.

**Passwordless authentication is still a relatively new technology, but it is quickly gaining popularidad  because of its security benefits, improved user experience, and reduced risk of fraud.**

## What is PKI (public key infrastructure)?

**PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**

PKI is a framework for securely managing and distributing public keys, which are used in asymmetric cryptography to establish secure communication channels.

**Components of PKI:**

* **Certification Authority (CA):** A trusted third-party that issues and validates digital certificates.
* **Digital Certificates:** Electronic documents that bind a public key to the identity of an entity (e.g., a website, email address, or user).
* **Registration Authority (RA):** Optional component that verifies and approves entities for certificate issuance.
* **Public Key Repository:** Database that stores and distributes public keys and certificates.

**How PKI Works:**

1. **Key Generation:** Entities generate a pair of public and private keys.
2. **Certificate Request:** Entities submit a certificate request to a CA, including their public key.
3. **Certificate Issuance:** The CA verifies the entity's identity and issues a digital certificate containing the public key linked to the entity's identity.
4. **Validation:** Entities trust the CA to have conducted thorough identity verification, and rely on the certificate to authenticate the entity holding the corresponding private key.
5. **Secure Communication:** Communication is established using asymmetric cryptography. Public keys are used to encrypt messages, while private keys are used to decrypt them.

**Benefits of PKI:**

* **Strong Authentication:** Verifies the identity of communicating parties.
* **Data Integrity:** Ensures that data has not been tampered with.
* **Confidentiality:** Protects data from unauthorized access.
* **Non-repudiation:** Provides proof that a message was sent or received by a specific entity.

**Applications of PKI:**

* Secure websites (HTTPS)
* Email encryption (S/MIME)
* Electronic signatures
* Code signing
* Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

**Tribunal Criticizes PSNI and Met Police for Spying Operation to Identify Journalists' Sources**

A tribunal has strongly criticized the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the Metropolitan Police (Met) for conducting a covert spying operation aimed at identifying journalists' sources.

**Background**

In 2013, the PSNI and Met launched an operation codenamed "Kenova" to investigate leaks of classified information. They suspected that journalists were receiving leaks from within the security services.

**Operation Kenova**

The operation involved intercepting the communications of journalists and their sources, including phone calls, emails, and text messages. The police also used other methods, such as surveillance and undercover officers, to gather information.

**Tribunal Findings**

A public inquiry into Operation Kenova concluded that the police had "acted inappropriately" and "had failed to meet the standards required of a democratic society." The tribunal found that:

* The police had intercepted the communications of journalists without reasonable suspicion.
* The operation had been conducted in secret, without the knowledge of the journalists involved.
* The police had not properly considered the impact on freedom of the press and the protection of sources.

**Criticism**

The tribunal's findings have sparked widespread criticism of the PSNI and Met. Critics argue that the operation was an attack on the right of journalists to protect their sources and that it has damaged public trust in the police.

**Response from the Police**

Both the PSNI and Met have issued apologies for the operation. However, they have also defended their actions, arguing that they were necessary to prevent leaks of sensitive information.

**Implications**

The tribunal's findings are significant because they:

* Reinforce the importance of freedom of the press.
* Highlight the need for the police to respect the confidentiality of journalists' sources.
* Raise concerns about the use of covert surveillance by the police.

**Future Action**

The government has announced that it will review the findings of the tribunal and consider what action to take. This could include changes to the law or guidance on the use of surveillance by the police.
