Published: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 08:15:00 GMT

Saudi Arabia has called for the development of "humanitarian AI" after the kingdom cracked down on human rights protesters. The kingdom has been accused of using spyware to track dissidents, and of jailing activists who speak out against the government.

In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that AI could be used to "improve the lives of millions of people around the world." He said that AI could be used to "detect early signs of disease, provide personalized education, and create new opportunities for economic growth."

However, the Crown Prince did not address the concerns of human rights groups, who are concerned that AI could be used to further suppress dissent in Saudi Arabia.

Human Rights Watch has called on Saudi Arabia to end its crackdown on human rights protesters, and to release all political prisoners. The organization has also called on the kingdom to implement reforms that would protect freedom of expression and assembly.

It is unclear whether Saudi Arabia's call for "humanitarian AI" is a genuine attempt to improve the lives of its citizens, or a way to distract from the kerajaan's human rights abuses.

## What is a public key and how does it work?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key)

Published: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**What is a Public Key?**

A public key is a cryptographic key that is used in public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography. It is a mathematical formula that can be used to encrypt information, but which cannot be used to decrypt it.

**How it Works:**

Public-key cryptography relies on the concept of a "key pair," which consists of a public key and a corresponding private key.

* **Public key:** Made public and can be shared with anyone.
* **Private key:** Kept secret and should only be known to the owner.

**Encryption Process:**

When someone wants to send a secure message to you, they use your public key to encrypt the message. The public key is designed to allow encryption but not decryption.

**Decryption Process:**

Only the private key, held by you, can decrypt the message that was encrypted with your public key. This is because the public key and private key are mathematically linked in a way that only allows the private key to undo the encryption performed by the public key.

**Advantages of Public-Key Cryptography:**

* **Confidentiality:** Only the recipient with the private key can decrypt the encrypted message.
* **Authentication:** If a message is encrypted with your public key and can be decrypted with your private key, it proves that it originated from you (since only you have the private key).
* **Digital signatures:** Public keys can be used to create digital signatures, which can certify the authenticity and integrity of a digital document.

**Examples of Public Key Use:**

Public-key cryptography is widely used in various applications, including:

* Secure email (e.g., PGP, S/MIME)
* Website security (e.g., SSL/TLS)
* Code signing
* Blockchain technology (e.g., Bitcoin wallets)

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/proxy-firewall)

Published: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Proxy Firewall**

A proxy firewall is a network security device that acts as an intermediary between clients and the external network. It intercepts and filters all incoming and outgoing network traffic, enforcing security policies and protecting the internal network from external threats.

**How it Works:**

1. **Client-Proxy Connection:** Clients (e.g., computers, smartphones) connect to the proxy firewall instead of directly to the external network.
2. **Request Forwarding:** When a client sends a request to an external server, the proxy firewall forwards the request to the server on behalf of the client.
3. **Response Handling:** The proxy firewall receives the response from the server and forwards it back to the client.
4. **Filtering and Inspection:** Before forwarding requests and responses, the proxy firewall inspects the traffic for malicious content, viruses, or other threats based on predefined security rules.
5. **Logging and Reporting:** The proxy firewall logs all network traffic, providing visibility into activity and enabling security auditing.

**Benefits of a Proxy Firewall:**

* **Enhanced Security:** Filters and blocks malicious traffic, preventing unauthorized access and data breaches.
* **Anonymity:** Hides the real IP addresses of clients, enhancing privacy and protecting from identity theft.
* **Content Filtering:** Blocks or limits access to inappropriate or restricted websites based on organizational policies.
* **Traffic Control:** Manages network bandwidth by enforcing bandwidth limits, prioritizing critical applications, and preventing network congestion.
* **Centralized Security:** Allows administrators to manage security policies from a single interface, providing consistent protection across the network.

**Types of Proxy Firewalls:**

* **Forward Proxy:** Accepts client requests and forwards them to the destination server without modifying the data.
* **Reverse Proxy:** Accepts server responses and distributes them to multiple clients, providing load balancing and caching capabilities.
* **Intercepting Proxy:** Inspects and modifies data before forwarding it, enabling deep packet inspection and data filtering.

Published: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:10:00 GMT

**Latest Attempt to Override UK’s Outdated Hacking Law Stalls**

**London, UK:** The UK government's latest attempt to update its outdated hacking law has stalled due to resistance from within the Conservative Party.

The Computer Misuse Act (CMA), enacted in 1990, criminalizes unauthorized access to computer systems but has been widely criticized as being overly broad and outdated. In recent years, there have been calls to reform the CMA to better reflect the technological advancements of the digital age.

In 2022, the government introduced the Online Safety Bill, which included provisions to amend the CMA. The bill would have introduced new offenses, such as "knowingly or recklessly" interfering with a computer system, addressing concerns about individuals who exploit vulnerabilities for malicious purposes.

However, Conservative MPs have voiced opposition to the bill's approach to online safety, arguing that it could stifle legitimate research and security testing. The government has since announced that the CMA amendments will be dropped from the Online Safety Bill, leaving the outdated hacking law in place.

Digital rights groups have expressed disappointment with the government's decision. The Open Rights Group said the move was "a major setback for digital rights and the rule of law."

The CMA has been criticized for its vague language and the potential for unintended consequences. In 2014, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) issued guidelines on the CMA to provide clarity, but it remains a complex law to interpret and enforce.

The government's decision to stall the CMA amendments raises concerns about the UK's ability to address emerging cyber threats effectively. Law enforcement agencies have argued that the current CMA is insufficient to deter sophisticated hackers and protect critical infrastructure.

The future of the CMA remains uncertain. The government has indicated that it may consider reforming the law separately from the Online Safety Bill. However, it is unclear when or if such reforms will be introduced.

Until then, the UK's outdated hacking law continues to pose challenges for law enforcement, businesses, and digital rights advocates alike.

A public key certificate is a digital document that verifies the identity of a website or organization and binds it to a public key. This certificate is issued by a trusted third party, known as a Certificate Authority (CA), after verifying the organization's identity and its control over the domain or service being certified.

The certificate contains the following information:

• The organization's identity (represented by its domain name or other identifying information)
• The public key (which is used to encrypt communications)
• The digital signature of the CA that issued the certificate
• Information about the certificate's validity period and usage

When a client accesses a website or service that uses a public key certificate, the client's browser or other software automatically retrieves the certificate and verifies its authenticity and validity. If the certificate is valid, the client will accept the server's public key as genuine and establish a secure connection.

Public key certificates play a crucial role in securing online communications and transactions. They help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure that data transmitted between the client and the server remains confidential and has not been tampered with.

For example, when you visit a website that uses HTTPS, the website's server presents its public key certificate to your browser. Your browser checks the certificate against a list of trusted CAs, ensures that it is valid and has not been revoked, and then uses the public key to encrypt the connection between your browser and the server. This encryption ensures that any data you transmit to the server (such as your login credentials or credit card information) remains confidential and cannot be intercepted by third parties.
