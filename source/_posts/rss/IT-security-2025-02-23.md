**UK Accused of Political 'Foreign Cyber Attack' on US After Secret Snooping Order on Apple**

**Background:**

The United Kingdom has been accused of carrying out a politically motivated "foreign cyber attack" on the United States by issuing a secret national security order to Apple demanding access to encrypted data on an iPhone connected to a US citizen.

**The Order:**

In 2018, British authorities reportedly served a national security order on Apple, compelling the company to assist in decrypting an iPhone belonging to a US citizen suspected of involvement in a terror plot. Apple, under US law, is prohibited from complying with such requests without a court order from a US authority.

**Apple's Refusal:**

Apple refused to comply with the order, arguing that it could set a dangerous precedent and compromise the security of millions of its devices worldwide. The company also cited the fact that the target of the order was a US citizen and that the order was issued without any US judicial oversight.

**UK's Defense:**

The UK government has defended its actions, stating that it has the right to take necessary measures to protect its national security. It also claims that the order was lawful and proportionate under UK law.

**US Response:**

The US government has expressed concerns over the UK's actions, calling them a "serious matter." The Biden administration has stated that it is reviewing the incident and will work with the UK to address any potential violations of US law.

**Allegation of Political Motivation:**

Critics have accused the UK of using the national security order for political reasons, specifically to pressure the US into extraditing WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Assange is a UK citizen who is currently facing extradition to the US on charges related to the leaking of classified documents.

**Implications:**

The incident has raised concerns about the potential for foreign governments to misuse national security powers to target political opponents or interfere in other countries' affairs. It has also highlighted the tension between national security and individual privacy rights.

**Ongoing Investigation:**

The incident is currently under investigation by the US Department of Justice, which is examining whether the UK's actions violated any US laws or international agreements.

**London, 15 December 2022** - The UK government has sanctioned a Russian cyber crime network known as "Zservers" for its involvement in a series of high-profile cyber attacks, including the ransomware attack on the NHS in 2017.

The sanctions target six individuals and two entities associated with the Zservers network, including its founder Evgeniy Bogachev. The individuals are subject to asset freezes and travel bans, while the entities are subject to asset freezes.

The UK government says that the Zservers network has been responsible for a range of malicious activities, including:

* The development and distribution of ransomware, which encrypts victims' data and demands a ransom payment to decrypt it
* The theft of financial data from banks and other financial institutions
* The distribution of botnets, which are networks of infected computers that can be used to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
* The sale of stolen personal data on the dark web

The sanctions are a significant step in the UK government's efforts to crack down on cyber crime. They send a clear message that the UK will not tolerate cyber attacks from any source.

The sanctions are also a warning to other cyber criminals that the UK is prepared to take action against them. The government is committed to protecting the UK from cyber threats, and it will use all available tools to do so.

The Zservers network is one of the most sophisticated and prolific cyber crime networks in the world. The sanctions against the network are a major victory for law enforcement, and they will help to make the UK a safer place from cyber crime.
