Published: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 13:49:00 GMT

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is a United States federal law that was enacted in 1999. The GLBA was intended to modernize the financial services industry by repealing the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which had separated commercial banking, investment banking, and insurance. The GLBA also included provisions to protect consumers' financial privacy.

The GLBA has been the subject of some controversy, with critics arguing that it has led to a consolidation of the financial industry and increased risk-taking by banks. However, the GLBA has also been credited with helping to spur economic growth and improve access to financial services for consumers.

The GLBA's main provisions include:

* Repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, allowing financial institutions to engage in a wider range of activities, including banking, investment banking, and insurance.
* Establishment of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a body responsible for monitoring the financial system and identifying risks to its stability.
* Creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency responsible for protecting consumers' financial privacy.
* Implementation of a number of consumer protection measures, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Truth in Lending Act (TILA).

The GLBA has had a significant impact on the financial services industry. It has led to a consolidation of the industry, with a number of large banks acquiring smaller banks and other financial institutions. The GLBA has also increased risk-taking by banks, as they are now able to engage in a wider range of activities. However, the GLBA has also helped to spur economic growth and improve access to financial services for consumers.

## What is a proxy firewall?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/proxy-firewall)

Published: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Definition:**

A proxy firewall is a type of firewall that acts as an intermediary between a client (e.g., a computer) and a server. It intercepts and filters network traffic before it reaches the destination server.

**Purpose:**

The main purpose of a proxy firewall is to:

* Enhance security by controlling access to the network and blocking malicious traffic.
* Enhance privacy by hiding the client's IP address and other identifying information from external servers.
* Improve performance by caching frequently accessed content and reducing latency.

**How it Works:**

When a client sends a request to a server, it is intercepted by the proxy firewall. The firewall then:

1. **Inspects the request:** Checks for malicious content, viruses, or other threats.
2. **Authenticates the client:** Verifies that the client is authorized to access the network and resources.
3. **Redirects the request:** Forwards the request to the destination server on behalf of the client.
4. **Monitors the response:** Intercepts and analyzes the response from the server for any security risks.
5. **Returns the response to the client:** The firewall returns the response to the client, either transparently or with modifications.

**Types of Proxy Firewalls:**

* **Forward proxies (Type 1):** The most common type, which provides a simple intermediary between clients and servers.
* **Reverse proxies (Type 2):** Protects web servers and other services by handling incoming requests and distributing them to the appropriate back-end servers.
* **SOCKS proxies (Type 4):** Supports different network protocols, including TCP and UDP, and provides more advanced features such as authentication and encryption.

**Benefits of Proxy Firewalls:**

* **Enhanced security:** Provides an additional layer of protection against external threats.
* **Increased privacy:** Hides the client's IP address and other sensitive information.
* **Improved performance:** Caches and optimizes network traffic, reducing latency and improving user experience.
* **Flexible configuration:** Allows for customized filtering rules and access controls.

## What is a public key and how does it work?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key)

Published: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Public Key**

A public key is a cryptographic key that is used to encrypt data. It is made public and can be shared with anyone. Anyone who knows the public key can use it to encrypt data, but only the person who has the corresponding private key can decrypt that data.

**How it Works**

Public keys work in conjunction with private keys to provide secure communication over an insecure channel. The key pair consists of:

1. **Private Key:** Only known to the owner. Used to decrypt data encrypted with the public key.

2. **Public Key:** Publically available. Used to encrypt data that only the owner of the private key can decrypt.

**Encryption Process**

* **Using the Public Key:** When you want to send data to someone, you use their public key to encrypt it. Anyone with access to the public key can encrypt data for that person.
* **Private Key Decryption:** Only the intended recipient has the corresponding private key, which they use to decrypt the encrypted data. No one else can decrypt the data without the private key.

**Applications**

Public keys are used in various secure communication applications, including:

* Secure Email (PGP, S/MIME)
* Secure Messaging Apps (WhatsApp, Signal)
* HTTPS (web browsing)
* Digital Signatures
* Cryptocurrency Transactions

**Key Features**

* **One-Way Encryption:** It is computationally impossible to derive the private key from the public key.
* **Asymmetric Cryptography:** Uses different keys for encryption (public) and decryption (private).
* **Confidentiality:** Data encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted by the holder of the corresponding private key.
* **Authentication:** Digital signatures using public keys verify the authenticity and integrity of messages.

Published: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:10:00 GMT

**Latest Attempt to Override UK’s Outdated Hacking Law Stalls**

London, England - A recent effort to modernize the United Kingdom's outdated Computer Misuse Act (CMA) has hit a roadblock. The bill, which aimed to address vulnerabilities in the current law and provide clarity on acceptable hacking practices, has been paused indefinitely.

**CMA's Limitations**

The CMA was enacted in 1990, when computer hacking was in its infancy. As technology has evolved, the law has become increasingly inadequate to address modern hacking techniques and the proliferation of cybercrime.

**Proposed Changes**

The proposed bill aimed to:

* Update definitions of hacking and cybercrime to reflect current technology.
* Create a new defense of "responsible disclosure," allowing security researchers to report vulnerabilities without fear of prosecution.
* Increase penalties for malicious hacking.

**Reasons for Stalling**

The bill's progress was halted due to concerns raised by law enforcement agencies. They argued that the proposed changes would make it more difficult to prosecute hackers and hamper their ability to investigate cybercrime.

Additionally, some members of Parliament expressed skepticism about the need for a new law, suggesting that the CMA could be amended to address the outstanding concerns.

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key-certificate)

Published: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

A public key certificate is a digital document that binds a public key to an entity, such as an individual, an organization, or a website. It is used to verify the identity of the entity and to ensure that the public key is genuine.

Public key certificates are issued by certificate authorities (CAs), which are trusted third parties that verify the identity of the entity before issuing a certificate. The certificate contains the following information:

* The name of the entity
* The entity's public key
* The CA's digital signature
* The validity period of the certificate

Public key certificates are used in a variety of applications, including:

* Secure websites (HTTPS)
* Email encryption
* Code signing
* Software distribution

When you visit a secure website, the website's server sends its public key certificate to your browser. Your browser verifies the certificate and, if it is valid, uses the public key to encrypt the data that you send to the website. This ensures that the data is only accessible to the website, and not to any third parties.

Public key certificates are an important part of the public key infrastructure (PKI), which provides the security for online transactions.

**Conservative MP Adds to Calls for Public Inquiry over PSNI Police Spying**

A Conservative MP has joined calls for a public inquiry into the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) over allegations of spying on Irish nationalist communities.

Simon Hoare, the MP for North Dorset, said that the "breathtaking" allegations demanded a "most urgent and transparent investigation".

The PSNI has been accused of infiltrating Irish nationalist groups and using illegal tactics, including the use of informants, to gather intelligence.

The allegations were first made by former PSNI officers and have been corroborated by a recent independent report.

The report, by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, found that the PSNI's Special Branch had engaged in "collusive behaviour" with paramilitary groups during the Troubles.

The findings have raised concerns about the integrity of the PSNI and its ability to police the community fairly.

Mr Hoare said that the allegations were "serious and deeply concerning".

"The public has a right to know the truth about these allegations," he said.

"A public inquiry is the only way to restore confidence in the police and ensure that the rule of law is upheld."

The call for a public inquiry has been supported by Irish nationalist politicians and human rights groups.

The PSNI has said that it is committed to "transparency and accountability" and that it will cooperate fully with any investigation.

However, the police force has also defended its record, saying that it has worked hard to build trust with the community.

The issue is likely to be debated in the UK Parliament in the coming weeks.

* **Improved user experience:** Passwordless authentication is more convenient and faster than traditional methods, especially on mobile devices.
* **Reduced IT costs:** Password management and resets can be a significant burden for IT departments. Passwordless authentication reduces these costs by eliminating the need for password management and recovery processes.

**Types of Passwordless Authentication Methods:**

* **Biometrics:** Using unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, to verify identity.
* **One-Time Passcodes (OTPs):** Generating time-sensitive codes sent via text message, email, or mobile app that are valid for a single login attempt.
* **Physical Tokens:** Using hardware devices, such as USB keys or smart cards, that store cryptographic keys or generate one-time passcodes.
* **Magic Links:** Sending a unique link via email or text message that grants access to an account when clicked.

**Implementation Considerations:**

Implementing passwordless authentication requires careful planning and consideration of factors such as:

* **Security:** Ensuring that the methods used are secure and resistant to potential vulnerabilities.
* **Usability:** Making the process user-friendly and accessible for all types of users.

By adopting passwordless authentication strategies, organizations and individuals can enhance security, improve user experience, and streamline account management processes.

## What is PKI (public key infrastructure)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/PKI)

Published: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)** is a set of protocols, processes, and technologies that create, manage, distribute, use, revoke, and store digital certificates. Digital certificates contain a public key that is linked to a specific entity (e.g., a person, organization, server) and is used to verify the authenticity of the entity.

**Components of PKI:**

* **Certificate Authority (CA):** Trusted third-party entity that issues and manages certificates.
* **Registration Authority (RA):** Validates the identity of entities requesting certificates.
* **Revocation Authority:** Manages the revocation of compromised or expired certificates.
* **Directories:** Stores and distributes certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs).
* **Clients and Servers:** Entities that use certificates for authentication and secure communication.

**How PKI Works:**

1. **Certificate Request:** An entity requests a certificate from a CA, providing proof of identity.
2. **Certificate Issuance:** The CA verifies the entity's identity and issues a certificate containing the entity's public key, validity period, and other details.
3. **Certificate Distribution:** The certificate is distributed to the entity.
4. **Authentication and Verification:** When an entity communicates with a client or server, it presents its certificate. The recipient verifies the certificate using the CA's public key to ensure its authenticity.
5. **Revocation:** If a certificate is compromised or expires, the CA revokes it and informs other entities through CRLs.

**Benefits of PKI:**

* **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of entities in electronic transactions.
* **Confidentiality:** Encrypts data using public-private key pairs.
* **Integrity:** Ensures that data has not been tampered with.
* **Non-repudiation:** Prevents entities from denying their involvement in transactions.
* **Trust and Security:** Establishes a trusted framework for secure communication.

**Applications of PKI:**

* Secure websites (SSL/TLS)
* Email encryption (S/MIME)
* Digital signatures
* Secure file transfers
* Cloud computing
* Internet of Things (IoT)
