## Latest attempt to override UK’s outdated hacking law stalls
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366617109/Latest-attempt-to-override-UKs-outdated-hacking-law-stalls)

**Latest Attempt to Override UK’s Outdated Hacking Law Stalls**

The UK government's latest attempt to override its outdated hacking law has stalled, leaving campaigners and experts frustrated.

The Computer Misuse Act (CMA), enacted in 1990, has long been criticized for being too broad and outdated. It criminalizes unauthorized access to computer systems, even for legitimate purposes such as security research.

In 2019, the government launched a consultation on proposed reforms to the CMA. The reform package sought to introduce a new "authorized access" defense and create a new offense of "unauthorized access with intent to impair."

However, the consultation has been delayed multiple times, with the government last week announcing that it has been withdrawn.

"The government has decided to withdraw its proposals for reform of the Computer Misuse Act and will undertake further work to consider the issues raised in the consultation," the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said in a statement.

Campaigners and experts have expressed disappointment at the government's decision.

"The government's decision to withdraw its proposals is a major setback for the UK's tech industry," said Matt Warman, MP and Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. "The CMA is an outdated law that stifles innovation and research."

Dr. Ian Levy, Technical Director of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), said that the government's decision "is a missed opportunity to modernize our laws and provide greater clarity and certainty for businesses and researchers."

The CMA has been criticized for its overly broad definition of unauthorized access. For example, it has been used to prosecute researchers who have accessed computer systems to look for vulnerabilities without the permission of the system owner.

The proposed reforms would have introduced a new "authorized access" defense, which would have allowed researchers and others to access computer systems without authorization for legitimate purposes, such as security research.

The government's decision to withdraw its proposals for reform of the CMA is a blow to efforts to modernize the UK's outdated hacking law. It remains to be seen when and if the government will bring forward new proposals for reform.

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key-certificate)

Published: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

A public key certificate, also known as a digital certificate, is an electronic document that serves the following purposes:

* **Identity Verification:** It verifies the identity of the website, server, or entity that is presented online. It is similar to presenting a passport or ID card in the physical world.

* **Public Key Distribution:** It contains the public key of the entity, which is used for encrypting data sent to it. The public key is a unique digital code that allows the receiver to decrypt messages that are encrypted with the corresponding private key.

* **Validation of Signature:** It includes a digital signature from a trusted third party, known as a Certificate Authority (CA), which confirms the authenticity and integrity of the certificate.

Here's a simplified analogy to illustrate its function:

* **Envelope with Address and Stamp:** The public key certificate is like a sealed envelope.
* **Public Address:** The public key is the address written on the envelope.
* **Private Key:** The corresponding private key is like a secret code inside the envelope.
* **Postmark and Seal:** The digital signature from the CA is like a postmark and seal, ensuring the authenticity of the envelope.

In practice, when you visit a secure website, your browser checks for its public key certificate. If the certificate is valid and trusted by your browser, it establishes a secure connection using the public key to encrypt data. This ensures that your sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, is protected from eavesdropping or interception.

[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366617360/French-court-refuses-to-expedite-trial-of-Sky-ECC-cryptophone-distributor-Thomas-Herdman)

Published: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 06:53:00 GMT

**Paris, France** - A French court has rejected a request to expedite the trial of Thomas Herdman, the alleged distributor of the Sky ECC encrypted communications platform.

Herdman was arrested in 2021 and charged with organized crime, money laundering, and drug trafficking. Prosecutors believe he played a key role in distributing Sky ECC devices to criminal organizations worldwide.

Last month, Herdman's lawyers requested that his trial be expedited so that he could clear his name. However, the court ruled that the investigation is ongoing and that there is no urgent need to hold a trial at this time.

The court's decision is a setback for Herdman, who has been in custody for over a year. His lawyers have argued that he is innocent and that he should be released while awaiting trial.

The Sky ECC platform was used by criminal organizations to communicate securely about their illegal activities. Law enforcement agencies around the world were able to crack the encryption in 2021, leading to a series of arrests and seizures.

Herdman is one of several individuals who have been charged in connection with the Sky ECC investigation. The trial of Vincent Ramos, the alleged founder of Sky ECC, is scheduled to begin in 2024.

The refusal to expedite Herdman's trial is a reminder that the French justice system is often slow and bureaucratic. It can take years for cases to come to trial, and defendants can spend long periods in custody before their guilt or innocence is determined.

[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366617283/Conservative-MP-adds-to-calls-for-public-enquiry-over-PSNI-police-spying)

Published: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:45:00 GMT

**Conservative MP adds to calls for public inquiry over PSNI police spying**

* DUP and Alliance Party also back inquiry into alleged spying by Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) on solicitors
* PSNI denies wrongdoing but has agreed to review allegations

A Conservative MP has added his voice to calls for a public inquiry into alleged spying by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) on solicitors.

David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said on Tuesday that the allegations were "deeply concerning" and that "a full and transparent investigation is needed".

The DUP and Alliance Party have also backed calls for an inquiry.

The allegations stem from a report by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, which found that the PSNI had spied on a number of solicitors between 2002 and 2008.

The report found that the PSNI had used covert surveillance techniques, such as phone taps and bugs, to gather information on the solicitors.

The PSNI has denied any wrongdoing, but has agreed to review the allegations.

Mr Davis said that the allegations were "a serious threat to the rule of law" and that "it is essential that the public have confidence in the impartiality and integrity of the police".

He said that a public inquiry was the best way to get to the bottom of the allegations and to restore public confidence in the PSNI.

The DUP's Gregory Campbell said that an inquiry was "the only way to get to the truth" of the allegations.

He said that the people of Northern Ireland "deserve to know if the PSNI was spying on them illegally".

The Alliance Party's Stephen Farry said that an inquiry was "essential" to ensure that the PSNI was "accountable to the public".

He said that the allegations had "cast a shadow over the PSNI's reputation".

The PSNI has said that it is "committed to transparency and accountability" and that it will "co-operate fully" with any inquiry.

However, it has also said that it believes that the allegations are "unfounded".

The PSNI said that it had "a long history of working with solicitors" and that it "values the relationship".

It said that it had "no interest in spying on solicitors" and that it "would not tolerate any such activity".

The PSNI said that it had "already taken steps to review our practices" and that it would "continue to do so".

Passwordless authentication, also known as passwordless login or zero-trust authentication, is a method of accessing an online account or application without the use of a traditional password. It typically involves the use of alternative authentication methods, such as:

* **Biometric authentication:** Using unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice recognition, to verify the user's identity.
* **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Requiring multiple different factors of authentication, such as a one-time password (OTP) sent to a phone or email, to verify the user's identity.
* **Magic links:** Sending a unique link to the user's email or phone, which when clicked, logs the user into the account without requiring a password.
* **Security keys:** Inserting a physical security key into the device to verify the user's identity.

Passwordless authentication aims to improve security by eliminating the vulnerabilities associated with traditional passwords, which can be easily stolen, cracked, or leaked. By utilizing alternative authentication methods, passwordless authentication provides a more secure and convenient way to access online accounts and applications.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a system that enables the secure exchange of information between two parties over an untrusted network. It is used to create a secure communication channel between two parties by using public key encryption and digital certificates.

PKI utilizes a pair of cryptographic keys, a public key and a private key. The public key is made publicly available, while the private key is kept secret. When one party wants to send a message to another party, they encrypt the message using the recipient's public key. Only the recipient can decrypt the message using their corresponding private key.

PKI also uses digital certificates to verify the identity of the parties involved in the communication. A digital certificate is an electronic document that contains information about the certificate holder, such as their name, email address, and public key. The certificate is signed by a trusted third party, known as a Certificate Authority (CA), which verifies the identity of the certificate holder.

PKI is used in a variety of applications, including:

* Secure web browsing (HTTPS)
* Email encryption (S/MIME)
* Secure file transfer (SFTP)
* Digital signatures
* Code signing
* Authentication and authorization

PKI plays a critical role in ensuring the security and privacy of online communications. By using PKI, businesses and individuals can protect their sensitive information from unauthorized access and eavesdropping.
