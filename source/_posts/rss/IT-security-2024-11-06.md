## What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/two-factor-authentication)

Published: Mon, 28 Oct 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Two-factor authentication (2FA), also known as two-step verification, is a security measure that requires you to provide two different forms of authentication when logging into an account. 

**The two factors of authentication typically include:**

1. **Something you know:** This is usually a password or PIN.
2. **Something you have:** This could be a physical token, such as a hardware security key or a smartphone with an authenticator app.

When you log into an account with 2FA enabled, you will be prompted to enter your password or PIN. You will then be prompted to provide the second factor of authentication, which could be a code generated by an authenticator app or a physical token.

By requiring two different forms of authentication, 2FA makes it much more difficult for attackers to gain access to your account, even if they have your password. This is because they would also need to have possession of your second factor of authentication.

2FA is a highly effective way to protect your accounts from unauthorised access. It is recommended that you enable 2FA for all of your important accounts, such as your email, banking, and social media accounts.

**Democracy campaigner to sue Saudi Arabia over Pegasus and QuaDream spyware in UK court**

A prominent democracy campaigner is suing Saudi Arabia in a UK court, alleging that the kingdom used spyware to hack his phone and those of his associates.

Yahya Assiri, the founder of the London-based Saudi Human Rights Monitor, claims that his phone was hacked using Pegasus and QuaDream spyware, which is made by Israeli firm NSO Group.

He alleges that the spyware was used to target him and his associates because of their criticism of the Saudi government.

Assiri's lawsuit is the first time that a UK court has been asked to rule on the use of spyware by a foreign government against UK citizens.

The case is being closely watched by human rights groups, who say that it could set an important precedent for holding governments accountable for the use of spyware.

"This is a landmark case that could have far-reaching implications for the protection of human rights in the digital age," said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), a human rights group that is supporting Assiri's lawsuit.

"If the UK court rules in favor of Assiri, it would send a clear message to governments around the world that they cannot use spyware to target activists and dissidents with impunity."

The Saudi government has denied Assiri's allegations, saying that it does not use spyware to target dissidents.

However, a number of independent investigations have found that Saudi Arabia has used Pegasus and QuaDream spyware to target activists, journalists, and other dissidents.

In 2021, a consortium of international media outlets published a report that found that Pegasus spyware had been used to target at least 50,000 people in 50 countries, including many journalists, activists, and politicians.

The report found that Saudi Arabia was one of the most prolific users of Pegasus spyware, targeting at least 2,000 people.

Assiri's lawsuit is scheduled to be heard in a UK court in the coming months.

This would help to improve coordination of care and reduce duplication of services.

The plan also includes a commitment to invest in new technology, such as artificial intelligence, to help the NHS become more efficient. This investment would be used to develop new tools and systems to help NHS staff deliver better care.

Labour's 10-year plan for the NHS is a welcome step towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the NHS. The commitment to open up data sharing is particularly important, as it would allow data to be shared more easily between different parts of the NHS. This would help to improve coordination of care and reduce duplication of services.

However, it is important to note that the plan is only a commitment at this stage. It is not clear how the plan will be implemented or how much funding will be made available. It is also important to note that data sharing can raise a number of privacy concerns. It is important to ensure that any data sharing is done in a way that protects the privacy of patients.
