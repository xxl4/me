## Many are called, but few are chosen: Secrets of MI5 watchers revealed
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366617964/Many-are-called-but-few-are-chosen-secrets-of-MI5-watchers-revealed)

Published: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 04:30:00 GMT

**Many are called, but few are chosen: Secrets of MI5 watchers revealed**

MI5, the UK's domestic intelligence service, has been secretly watching thousands of people for decades, according to a new book.

The book, **The Secret History of MI5**, by investigative journalist Tim Shipman, reveals that MI5 has been using a variety of methods to spy on people, including phone tapping, email interception, and surveillance.

Shipman writes that MI5 has been watching people for a variety of reasons, including suspected terrorism, espionage, and financial crime. He also reveals that MI5 has been targeting people who pose no threat to national security, including human rights activists and journalists.

The book's revelations have raised concerns about the extent of MI5's powers and the lack of oversight of its activities.

**MI5's secret watchers**

MI5 is responsible for protecting the UK from national security threats. It has a wide range of powers to investigate suspected terrorists, spies, and other criminals.

One of MI5's most controversial powers is its ability to watch people without their knowledge or consent. This power is known as **covert surveillance**.

Covert surveillance can involve a variety of methods, including phone tapping, email interception, and surveillance. MI5 can also use covert surveillance to track people's movements and activities.

**The scale of MI5's surveillance**

Shipman's book reveals that MI5 has been using covert surveillance on a massive scale. He writes that MI5 has been watching thousands of people for decades.

The people who have been watched by MI5 include suspected terrorists, spies, and other criminals. However, MI5 has also been watching people who pose no threat to national security, including human rights activists and journalists.

**The lack of oversight of MI5's activities**

MI5's activities are overseen by a number of bodies, including the Home Secretary, the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), and the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT).

However, these bodies have been criticized for being too weak to effectively oversee MI5's activities.

The ISC is a parliamentary committee that is responsible for scrutinizing the work of MI5 and the other intelligence agencies. However, the ISC has been criticized for being too close to the intelligence agencies and for failing to hold them to account.

The IPT is a tribunal that is responsible for reviewing the use of investigatory powers by the intelligence agencies. However, the IPT has been criticized for being too slow and for failing to provide effective redress for people who have been spied on unlawfully.

**The concerns about MI5's surveillance**

The revelations in Shipman's book have raised concerns about the extent of MI5's powers and the lack of oversight of its activities.

Critics argue that MI5 has been given too much power to spy on people without their knowledge or consent. They also argue that the oversight of MI5's activities is too weak and that there is a lack of accountability for the intelligence agencies.

The government has defended MI5's use of covert surveillance, arguing that it is necessary to protect national security. However, the government has also acknowledged that there is a need for greater oversight of MI5's activities.

The debate about the extent of MI5's powers and the need for oversight is likely to continue for some time.

**UK Government Plans to Extend Ransomware Payment Ban**

The UK government is planning to extend its ban on paying ransoms to cybercriminals in an effort to deter attacks.

The government's current ban, introduced in 2020, applies to public sector organisations. However, the new plans would extend the ban to the private sector as well.

The move comes as ransomware attacks have become increasingly common and costly. In 2021, ransomware attacks cost UK businesses an estimated £3.1 billion.

The government believes that paying ransoms encourages cybercriminals to continue attacking UK organisations. It is also concerned that paying ransoms can give criminals access to sensitive data, such as customer information and trade secrets.

The new plans would give the government the power to impose fines on organisations that pay ransoms. The government would also be able to seize the assets of organisations that are found to be involved in ransomware payments.

The government's plans have been welcomed by some in the cybersecurity industry. However, others have raised concerns that the ban could make it more difficult for organisations to recover from ransomware attacks.

The government has said that it is working closely with businesses and cybersecurity experts to develop guidance on how to deal with ransomware attacks without paying ransoms.
