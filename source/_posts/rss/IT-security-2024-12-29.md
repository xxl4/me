[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key)

Published: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**What is a Public Key?**

A public key is a mathematical value used in public-key cryptography, a type of encryption system that uses two keys: a public key and a private key. Public keys are designed to be publicly shared with anyone.

**How a Public Key Works:**

1. **Key Generation:** First, two mathematically related keys are generated: a public key and a private key. These keys are unique and cannot be derived from each other.

2. **Encryption:** When someone wants to send a secure message, they use the public key of the intended recipient to encrypt it. The public key can be published on a public directory or in a certificate.

3. **Encrypted Message:** Using an encryption algorithm, the sender encrypts the message using the public key. The resulting encrypted message is scrambled and can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key.

4. **Secure Transmission:** The encrypted message is sent to the intended recipient over a secure channel, such as an encrypted email or HTTPS connection.

**Deciphering the Encrypted Message:**

1. **Private Key Decryption:** Only the recipient has the corresponding private key, which they keep secret. They use it to decrypt the message.

2. **Decrypted Message:** The private key unlocks the encrypted message, revealing the original plaintext.

**Purpose and Advantages of Public Key Cryptography:**

* **Confidentiality:** Protects messages from unauthorized access, as only the intended recipient with the private key can decrypt them.
* **Authentication:** Allows for verifying the identity of the sender, as the public key is linked to their digital signature.
* **Key Distribution:** Eliminates the need to securely exchange secret keys over insecure channels, as public keys can be freely shared.
* **Digital Signatures:** Creates unforgeable digital signatures that prove the authenticity and integrity of electronic documents or transactions.

**Example:**

Alice sends an encrypted message to Bob. She uses Bob's public key to encrypt the message. Bob receives the encrypted message and uses his private key to decrypt it, ensuring that only he can read the message.

Published: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Public Key Certificate**

A public key certificate, also known as a **digital certificate** or **SSL certificate**, is a digital document that binds an entity (individual, organization, or system) to a public key. It verifies the authenticity of the public key and associates it with the entity's identity.

**Key Components of a Public Key Certificate:**

* **Subject:** The entity (individual, organization, or system) that holds the public key.
* **Issuer:** The trusted third-party (e.g., Certificate Authority) that issues the certificate.
* **Public Key:** The public key associated with the subject.
* **Signature:** A digital signature from the issuer that verifies the authenticity of the certificate.
* **Validity Period:** The start and end dates during which the certificate is valid.

**Purpose of a Public Key Certificate:**

Public key certificates are used to:

* Authenticate websites and email addresses (HTTPS, TLS/SSL)
* Enable secure communication (e.g., VPNs)
* Verify digital signatures and electronic documents
* Establish trust in online transactions
* Protect against phishing and other malicious attacks

**How it Works:**

1. A subject (e.g., website owner) requests a public key certificate from an issuer (e.g., Certificate Authority).
2. The issuer verifies the subject's identity and credentials.
3. The issuer generates the certificate and signs it with its private key.
4. The certificate is distributed to the subject.
5. When a user accesses the website or email, the website/email server presents the certificate to the user's browser or mail client.
6. The browser/mail client verifies the issuer's signature and checks the certificate's validity.
7. If the certificate is valid, the user's browser/mail client establishes a secure connection using the public key associated with the certificate.

**Importance:**

Public key certificates play a crucial role in establishing trust and securing online communications and transactions. They ensure that users are interacting with genuine websites and email addresses, and that their sensitive data remains protected.

**French Court Refuses to Expedite Trial of Sky ECC Cryptophone Distributor Thomas Herdman**

**Paris, France -** A French court has rejected a request to expedite the trial of Thomas Herdman, the alleged distributor of the encrypted communication platform Sky ECC. Herdman is accused of supplying the encrypted devices to criminal organizations worldwide.

The request for an expedited trial was made by Herdman's lawyer, who argued that his client had been detained for an excessive period of time and that he was anxious to clear his name. However, the court ruled that there was no justification for prioritizing Herdman's trial over other cases.

Herdman was arrested in April 2021 as part of a major international operation targeting the use of Sky ECC devices by criminals. The platform, which boasted over 70,000 users, allowed encrypted communication between devices, making it difficult for law enforcement to intercept messages.

Investigators believe that Sky ECC devices were used in a wide range of criminal activities, including drug trafficking, money laundering, and terrorism. The French authorities have described the Sky ECC network as "the WhatsApp of organized crime."

Herdman, a Canadian citizen, is accused of being the main distributor of Sky ECC devices in France. He has denied any wrongdoing and claims that he was unaware of the criminal activities carried out by users of the platform.

The trial of Herdman and several other defendants is scheduled to begin in October 2023. The case is expected to be complex and lengthy, due to the vast amount of evidence that must be presented.

The French court's decision not to expedite the trial has been met with mixed reactions. Some have expressed frustration that Herdman will have to wait over a year to face justice, while others have argued that due process must be respected.

The prosecution team has indicated that it will continue to gather evidence against Herdman and the other defendants. The outcome of the trial is likely to have significant implications for the use of encrypted communication platforms by criminals.

**Conservative MP adds to calls for public inquiry over PSNI police spying**

A Conservative MP has added to calls for a public inquiry into allegations that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) spied on politicians and journalists.

David Davies, the MP for Monmouth, said that the allegations were "deeply concerning" and that a public inquiry was needed to "get to the bottom" of what had happened.

His call comes after the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland (PONI) published a report that found that the PSNI had spied on journalists and politicians without their knowledge or consent.

The report found that the PSNI had used covert surveillance techniques, such as phone taps and bugging, to gather information on journalists and politicians. The PSNI has admitted that it spied on journalists, but has denied that it spied on politicians.

The PONI report has been welcomed by some politicians and journalists, but others have called for a public inquiry to be held.

Davies said that a public inquiry was needed to "restore public confidence" in the PSNI.

"The allegations that the PSNI have been spying on journalists and politicians are deeply concerning," he said. "It is essential that we get to the bottom of what has happened and hold those responsible to account."

"A public inquiry is the best way to do this. It would allow us to examine the evidence in detail and make recommendations for how to prevent this from happening again."

The call for a public inquiry has been backed by a number of other politicians, including the leader of the SDLP, Colum Eastwood, and the leader of the Alliance Party, Naomi Long.

The PSNI has said that it is "committed to transparency" and that it will cooperate with any public inquiry.

Passwordless authentication is a method of verifying a user's identity without requiring them to enter a password. 

**How does it work?** 

There are a few different ways to implement passwordless authentication, but some common methods include: 

* **Biometrics:** Using unique physical characteristics, such as a fingerprint or facial recognition, to verify a user's identity. 
* **One-time passcodes:** Sending a unique code to the user's device, which they must enter to login. 
* **Security keys:** Using a physical device, such as a USB key, to verify a user's identity. 

**What are the benefits of passwordless authentication?** 

There are several benefits to using passwordless authentication, including: 

* **Increased security:** Passwords are often vulnerable to hacking and other attacks, but passwordless authentication methods are much more difficult to compromise. 
* **Improved user experience:** Users no longer have to remember and enter complex passwords, making it easier and faster to login. 
* **Reduced IT costs:** Passwordless authentication can help to reduce IT costs by eliminating the need to manage and reset passwords. 

**What are the challenges of passwordless authentication?** 

There are a few challenges to implementing passwordless authentication, including: 

* **Cost:** Implementing passwordless authentication can be more expensive than traditional password-based authentication methods. 
* **User adoption:** Users may be reluctant to adopt new passwordless authentication methods, especially if they are not familiar with them. 
* **Security concerns:** Some passwordless authentication methods may not be as secure as traditional password-based authentication methods. 

**The future of passwordless authentication** 

Passwordless authentication is a rapidly evolving field, and there are a number of new methods being developed all the time. As these methods become more secure and user-friendly, they are likely to become more widely adopted.

## What is PKI (public key infrastructure)?

**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**

PKI is a system that provides security for electronic communication by managing and distributing public key certificates. It serves as the foundation for secure communication by establishing trust and authenticating digital identities.

**Components of PKI:**

* **Certificate Authority (CA):** A trusted third party that issues, verifies, and revokes digital certificates.
* **Digital Certificates:** Electronically signed documents that contain a public key, identifying information, and validity period.
* **Public Keys:** Cryptographic keys that are publicly available and used to encrypt messages.
* **Private Keys:** Cryptographic keys that are kept secret and used to decrypt messages.

**How PKI Works:**

1. **Certificate Request:** When a communication device (e.g., web server, email client) needs to establish a secure connection, it generates a public-private key pair. It then requests a digital certificate from a CA.
2. **Certificate Issuance:** The CA verifies the request and issues a digital certificate that binds the public key to the requestor's identity.
3. **Verification and Trust:** When communication is initiated, the receiving device verifies the sender's digital certificate against the CA's certificate. If the certificate is valid and trusted, the receiving device uses the public key to decrypt the encrypted message.

**Benefits of PKI:**

* **Authentication:** Provides a reliable way to verify the identity of communication parties.
* **Confidentiality:** Protects data from unauthorized access by encrypting messages.
* **Integrity:** Ensures that messages are not altered in transit.
* **Non-repudiation:** Prevents parties from denying that they sent or received a message.

**Applications of PKI:**

* Secure websites (HTTPS)
* Digital signatures
* Email encryption
* Virtual private networks (VPNs)
* Cloud computing
* Blockchain technology

**Tribunal Criticizes PSNI and Met Police for Spying Operation to Identify Journalistsâ€™ Sources**

A tribunal has harshly criticized both the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the Metropolitan Police (Met) for their involvement in a covert spying operation that aimed to uncover the sources of journalists.

**Operation Cardinal**

The operation, code-named Operation Cardinal, was launched in 2010 without the knowledge of the journalists or their sources. It involved covert surveillance, including phone tapping, to identify and expose those who had provided confidential information to the media.

**Breach of Trust and Confidence**

The tribunal, chaired by Judge Peter Smith, found that the spying operation was a "grave and serious" breach of trust and confidence. It concluded that the PSNI and Met had "acted unlawfully" by failing to obtain the necessary authorization and by failing to comply with legal safeguards.

**Chilling Effect on Journalism**

The tribunal further noted that the operation had a "chilling effect" on journalism. It stated that journalists have a vital role in holding those in power to account and that the public has a right to know about matters of public interest.

**Recommendations**

The tribunal has made a number of recommendations to prevent similar abuses in the future. These include:

* Requiring law enforcement agencies to obtain independent authorization before engaging in covert surveillance of journalists
* Establishing clear guidelines on the use of covert surveillance to protect the confidentiality of journalists' sources
* Providing journalists with legal protections against unlawful surveillance

**Reactions**

The findings of the tribunal have sparked widespread condemnation from journalists and human rights organizations. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) called the operation a "deplorable attack on press freedom and democracy."

The PSNI and Met have apologized for the operation and have pledged to implement the tribunal's recommendations. However, some critics have questioned whether these apologies are sufficient and have called for accountability for those responsible.
