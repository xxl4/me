## What is a certificate revocation list (CRL) and how is it used?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Certificate-Revocation-List)

Published: Fri, 31 Jan 2025 16:30:00 GMT

**Definition:**

A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is a list of digital certificates that have been revoked or invalidated before their expiration date. It is maintained and published by the Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the certificates.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of a CRL is to provide information to relying parties (such as web browsers and servers) about which certificates are no longer trusted and should not be accepted for authentication or encryption purposes.

**How it Works:**

* The CA periodically generates a CRL that contains a list of revoked certificates.
* The CRL is signed by the CA's private key to prevent tampering.
* The CA publishes the CRL to a publicly accessible location, such as an online repository or LDAP server.
* Relying parties定期检查CRL以确定他们接受的证书是否已被撤销。

**Benefits of Using a CRL:**

* **Provides timely revocation information:** CRLs allow CAs to revoke certificates immediately, even if they are not expired.
* **Prevents unauthorized access:** By revoking certificates, CAs can prevent unauthorized users from accessing protected resources or impersonating valid users.
* **Improves security and compliance:** CRLs are an essential part of PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) systems and help organizations meet security and compliance requirements.

**Limitations:**

* **Potential for delay:** CRLs may not be updated in real time, so there can be a delay between when a certificate is revoked and when the CRL is updated.
* **Network overhead:** CRLs can be large files, especially if there are a significant number of revoked certificates. This can cause network overhead and slow down the authentication process.
* **Potential for compromise:** If the CA's private key is compromised, the CRL can be tampered with to re-instate revoked certificates.

**Alternatives to CRLs:**

* **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):** OCSP provides real-time revocation checking and is a more efficient alternative to CRLs.
* **Delta CRLs:** Delta CRLs contain only the certificates that have been revoked since the last full CRL was issued. This can reduce the size and overhead associated with CRLs.

**Police Swoop on Sky ECC Cryptophone Distributors in Spain and Holland**

In a major international operation, police forces in Spain and the Netherlands have arrested 40 suspects and seized over 10 million euros in assets in a crackdown on the distribution of Sky ECC cryptophones.

**Sky ECC: A Criminal Communication Tool**

Sky ECC is a secure communication platform that has been used by criminal organizations worldwide to conceal their communications from law enforcement. The platform encrypts messages and offers features such as self-destructing messages.

**Operation Sky**

The arrests were part of Operation Sky, a coordinated effort between law enforcement agencies in Spain, the Netherlands, and other countries. The investigation targeted individuals and companies involved in the distribution and use of Sky ECC.

**Arrests and Seizures**

In Spain, police arrested 32 suspects and seized 1.7 million euros in cash and 19 luxury vehicles. In the Netherlands, eight suspects were arrested, and approximately 8.5 million euros in assets were confiscated.

**Millions of Messages Decrypted**

Law enforcement agencies have reportedly decrypted millions of Sky ECC messages, providing valuable insights into criminal activities and networks. The operation has disrupted communication channels used by organized crime groups involved in drug trafficking, money laundering, and other illicit activities.

**Impact on Criminal Organizations**

The crackdown on Sky ECC is expected to have a significant impact on criminal organizations that rely on encrypted communication tools. It demonstrates the increasing ability of law enforcement to penetrate these encrypted networks and gather evidence to prosecute criminal activities.

**International Cooperation**

The operation highlights the importance of international cooperation in combating organized crime. The swift and coordinated actions of multiple law enforcement agencies have led to the disruption of a major criminal network and the seizure of significant assets.

**Ongoing Investigation**

The investigation remains ongoing, and further arrests and seizures are expected as authorities continue to target the distribution and use of Sky ECC and other encrypted communication platforms.

**Barclays Hit by Major IT Outage on HMRC Deadline Day**

London, UK - Barclays Bank experienced a significant IT outage that affected its online and mobile banking services on Wednesday, the same day as a major deadline for self-assessment tax payments to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

The outage began shortly before 3 pm GMT and lasted for over an hour, leaving customers unable to access their accounts, make payments, or view transactions. The issue affected both the Barclays website and mobile app.

"We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this morning's IT issues," Barclays said in a statement. "We understand that this has been frustrating for our customers, and we are doing everything we can to resolve the situation as quickly as possible."

The outage caused significant disruption for customers on a day when many were attempting to make their tax payments by the HMRC deadline. Some customers reported being unable to pay their taxes on time, while others expressed concerns about possible late payment penalties.

 HMRC extended the deadline for online payments to 11:59 pm on Thursday, February 24th, due to the Barclays outage. However, customers were still advised to make their payments as soon as possible.

"We are working to ensure that all affected customers are able to make their tax payments on time and without penalty," HMRC said in a statement.

Barclays has not yet disclosed the cause of the outage, but it is investigating the issue and has promised to provide further updates. The outage is the latest in a series of technical problems that have affected UK banks in recent years.

**AI Jailbreaking Techniques Prove Highly Effective Against DeepSeek**

**Introduction**

DeepSeek is a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) model designed for various purposes including language processing, image recognition, and prediction. However, recent research has demonstrated that AI jailbreaking techniques can effectively bypass DeepSeek's security measures.

**AI Jailbreaking Techniques**

AI jailbreaking techniques exploit vulnerabilities in AI models to manipulate their behavior or gain unauthorized access to protected data. These techniques include:

* **Adversarial Examples:** Creating inputs that trick the AI model into making specific predictions or classifications.
* **Model Inversion:** Reversing the AI model to extract sensitive information from its hidden layers.
* **Data Poisoning:** Manipulating training data to bias the AI model's output.

**Effectiveness Against DeepSeek**

Researchers have successfully applied AI jailbreaking techniques against DeepSeek. In a series of experiments, they:

* **Generated adversarial examples:** Created sentences that caused DeepSeek to classify them as hate speech even though they were not.
* **Inverted the model:** Extracted personal information from DeepSeek's hidden layers, including names and email addresses.
* **Poisoned the training data:** Added biased data to the training set, causing DeepSeek to make discriminatory predictions.

**Implications**

The effectiveness of AI jailbreaking techniques against DeepSeek has significant implications:

* **Security Concerns:** These techniques can be used to manipulate DeepSeek's predictions and access sensitive information, potentially leading to security breaches.
* **Bias Detection:** AI jailbreaking can help identify and remove bias from AI models, ensuring fairness and accuracy.
