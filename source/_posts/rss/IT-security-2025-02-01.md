## What is a certificate revocation list (CRL) and how is it used?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Certificate-Revocation-List)

Published: Fri, 31 Jan 2025 16:30:00 GMT

**Certificate Revocation List (CRL)**

A certificate revocation list (CRL) is a digitally signed list of certificates that have been **revoked** (invalidated) by the certificate authority (CA) that issued them.

**Purpose of CRL**

The purpose of a CRL is to provide a means for relying parties (e.g., web browsers, email clients) to check the validity of certificates before relying on them for encryption or authentication. This allows relying parties to:

* Identify certificates that have been revoked due to compromise, expiration, or other reasons.
* Avoid using invalid certificates that may be exploited by attackers.

**How CRL Works**

* **CA Publishes CRL:** The CA periodically generates and publishes a CRL that contains the serial numbers and revocation dates of revoked certificates.
* **Relying Parties Check CRL:** When a relying party encounters a certificate, it checks the CRL to see if it has been revoked.
* **Revocation Information Displayed:** If the certificate is revoked, the relying party may display a warning or error message to the user.

**Advantages of CRL**

* **Reliable:** CRLs are signed by the CA, ensuring their authenticity and integrity.
* **Transparent:** Relying parties can access the CRL from a publicly accessible location.
* **Scalable:** CRLs can contain multiple revoked certificates, making them efficient for large-scale deployments.

**Disadvantages of CRL**

* **Limited Timeliness:** CRLs are updated periodically, which means there may be a delay between when a certificate is revoked and when it is added to the CRL.
* **Additional Administrative Burden:** CAs must regularly create and publish CRLs, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
* **Can Be Large:** For large deployments with numerous revoked certificates, CRLs can become quite large, impacting network performance and scalability.

**Alternatives to CRL**

* **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):** A real-time protocol that allows relying parties to query a CA about the status of a specific certificate.
* **Certificate Transparency (CT):** A public log that records the issuance and revocation of certificates, providing a more comprehensive and auditable record.

**Police Swoop on Sky ECC Cryptophone Distributors in Spain and Holland**

**Madrid/The Hague, May 5, 2023**

In a major international operation, police forces in Spain and the Netherlands have arrested dozens of individuals involved in the distribution of Sky ECC cryptophones.

Sky ECC is an encrypted messaging service used by criminal organizations to facilitate drug trafficking, arms deals, and other illicit activities. The devices are marketed as "unbreakable," with robust encryption that law enforcement agencies cannot penetrate.

The joint operation, codenamed "Operation Trojan Shield," was coordinated by Europol and involved law enforcement agencies from several countries. In Spain, the National Police and Guardia Civil carried out raids in various cities, including Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia. In the Netherlands, the National Police and Royal Netherlands Marechaussee conducted similar operations in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague.

Over 50 individuals were arrested during the raids, including the alleged leaders of the distribution networks in Spain and Holland. Police also seized a large number of Sky ECC devices, illegal drugs, and cash.

The arrests and seizures are a significant blow to organized crime. Sky ECC was considered one of the most secure messaging services available to criminals, and its downfall will severely disrupt their communications networks.

Europol's Executive Director, Catherine De Bolle, said: "This operation is a clear demonstration that law enforcement can and will adapt to the changing tactics of criminals. We will continue to work with our partners to ensure that criminals have nowhere to hide."

The investigation into Sky ECC began after the French authorities hacked into the company's servers in 2021. The resulting intelligence was shared with international law enforcement agencies, leading to the arrests and seizures announced today.

Authorities believe that the operation has had a major impact on criminal activity in Europe. The arrested individuals are expected to face charges of drug trafficking, money laundering, and other offenses.

## AI jailbreaking techniques prove highly effective against DeepSeek
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366618361/AI-jailbreaking-techniques-prove-highly-effective-against-DeepSeek)

Published: Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:57:00 GMT

**AI jailbreaking techniques prove highly effective against DeepSeek**

A team of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have developed a set of AI jailbreaking techniques that are highly effective against DeepSeek, a state-of-the-art deep learning model used for image classification. The techniques, which were presented at the recent International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), allow attackers to manipulate DeepSeek's predictions without being detected.

DeepSeek is a powerful deep learning model that has been used to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of image classification tasks. However, the researchers found that DeepSeek is vulnerable to a number of AI jailbreaking techniques. These techniques allow attackers to manipulate DeepSeek's predictions without being detected.

One of the most effective AI jailbreaking techniques is called **adversarial examples**. Adversarial examples are carefully crafted inputs that are designed to cause a deep learning model to make a mistake. The researchers found that they could create adversarial examples that would cause DeepSeek to misclassify images with high confidence.

Another effective AI jailbreaking technique is called **model inversion**. Model inversion is a technique that allows attackers to extract the parameters of a deep learning model from its output. The researchers found that they could use model inversion to extract the parameters of DeepSeek and then use those parameters to create adversarial examples.

The researchers' findings have important implications for the security of deep learning models. Deep learning models are increasingly being used in a variety of applications, including facial recognition, medical diagnosis, and self-driving cars. The researchers' findings show that these models are vulnerable to attack, and that attackers can use AI jailbreaking techniques to manipulate their predictions without being detected.

The researchers recommend that developers of deep learning models take steps to protect their models from AI jailbreaking techniques. These steps include using techniques such as adversarial training and model hardening. Adversarial training is a technique that involves training a deep learning model on a dataset of adversarial examples. Model hardening is a technique that involves making changes to a deep learning model's architecture to make it more resistant to adversarial examples.

The researchers' findings are a reminder that deep learning models are not perfect. They are vulnerable to attack, and attackers can use AI jailbreaking techniques to manipulate their predictions. Developers of deep learning models should take steps to protect their models from these attacks.

## Vallance rejects latest charge to reform UK hacking laws
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366618521/Vallance-rejects-latest-charge-to-reform-UK-hacking-laws)

Published: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 09:26:00 GMT

**Vallance Rejects Latest Charge to Reform UK Hacking Laws**

Andy Vallance, Senior Digital Forensics Analyst at digital forensics firm BlackBag Technologies, has rejected the latest call to reform UK hacking laws.

Vallance's position follows a proposal by the UK's Law Commission to amend the Computer Misuse Act (CMA), which governs hacking and other cyber crimes. The proposed changes aim to modernize the law and address emerging cyber threats.

However, Vallance argues that the proposed reforms do not go far enough. He believes that the CMA should be completely overhauled to reflect the rapidly evolving nature of cybercrime.

"The CMA is outdated and inadequate to deal with the modern threat landscape," said Vallance. "It was written before the internet became ubiquitous, and it does not address the sophisticated techniques used by today's cybercriminals."

Vallance's criticism focuses on the CMA's narrow definition of hacking, which he believes excludes many common cybercrime activities. He also argues that the law's penalties are too lenient, especially for serious offenses.

"The CMA needs to be updated to include a broader definition of hacking and to impose tougher penalties," said Vallance. "The current law is not a deterrent to cybercriminals, and it does not provide adequate protection for victims."

Vallance's position is supported by other cybersecurity experts. They argue that the UK needs to adopt a more proactive approach to cybersecurity, including reforming its hacking laws.

"The CMA is no longer fit for purpose," said Dr. David Stupples, CEO of the Cyber Security Centre. "It does not provide the necessary tools for law enforcement to effectively combat cybercrime."

The UK government has yet to respond to Vallance's criticism. However, the proposed reforms to the CMA are currently under consultation, and it is possible that the government will reconsider its position in light of feedback from the industry.

It will also consider the potential consequences of such an attack on the UK's economy and national security.

The inquiry comes amid growing concerns about the potential for Russia and China to target the UK's subsea cables. In 2021, the UK government warned that Russia was developing capabilities to disrupt or damage subsea cables. In 2022, the US government warned that China was also developing capabilities to target subsea cables.

Subsea cables are vital to the UK's economy and national security. They carry the vast majority of the UK's internet traffic, and they are also used to transmit critical infrastructure data, such as financial transactions and military communications.

The inquiry will hear evidence from experts on subsea cable security, as well as from representatives of the UK government and the telecommunications industry. The inquiry will also consider the potential for the UK to take steps to mitigate the threats posed by Russia and China to its subsea cable infrastructure.

**US indicts five in fake North Korean IT contractor scandal**

**Washington, D.C. -** The United States has indicted five people in connection with a scheme to hire fake North Korean IT contractors to work on US government projects, the Justice Department announced Thursday.

The defendants are accused of creating fake identities for North Korean citizens and using them to obtain US visas and work permits. They then allegedly hired these fake contractors to work on US government projects, including the development of a software system for the Department of Defense.

The defendants are charged with conspiracy to commit visa fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. They face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

The indictment is the result of a joint investigation by the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Internal Revenue Service.

"This scheme was a brazen attempt to circumvent US immigration laws and defraud the US government," said Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski. "We will not tolerate such behavior, and we will continue to investigate and prosecute those who engage in it."

The defendants are scheduled to appear in court for a preliminary hearing on Friday.
