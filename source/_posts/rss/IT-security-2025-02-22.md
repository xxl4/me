On August 1, 2023, the UK government announced new sanctions targeting the Russian cybercrime network Zservers. The sanctions include:

* Asset freezes against the network and its members
* Travel bans against the network's leaders
* Prohibition on doing business with the network or its members

The UK government said that Zservers is responsible for a wide range of cybercrimes, including ransomware attacks, data breaches, and financial fraud. The network has targeted businesses and individuals in the UK and around the world.

The sanctions are part of a broader effort by the UK government to crack down on cybercrime. The government has also invested in new technologies and resources to combat cyber threats.

The sanctions against Zservers are a significant step in the UK's fight against cybercrime. The sanctions will make it more difficult for the network to operate and will help to protect businesses and individuals from its attacks.

**What is Zservers?**

Zservers is a Russian cybercrime network that has been active since at least 2016. The network is responsible for a wide range of cybercrimes, including ransomware attacks, data breaches, and financial fraud. Zservers has targeted businesses and individuals in the UK and around the world.

The network is believed to be made up of a group of Russian hackers who are based in Russia and Eastern Europe. The hackers are highly skilled and have developed a number of sophisticated malware tools.

Zservers has been linked to a number of high-profile cyberattacks, including the ransomware attack on the NHS in 2017. The attack caused widespread disruption to the NHS's computer systems and cost the NHS millions of pounds.

**Why has the UK government sanctioned Zservers?**

The UK government has sanctioned Zservers because the network is responsible for a wide range of cybercrimes that have targeted businesses and individuals in the UK. The sanctions are part of a broader effort by the UK government to crack down on cybercrime.

The sanctions will make it more difficult for Zservers to operate and will help to protect businesses and individuals from its attacks.

**What are the sanctions?**

The sanctions against Zservers include:

* Asset freezes against the network and its members
* Travel bans against the network's leaders
* Prohibition on doing business with the network or its members

The asset freezes mean that Zservers and its members will not be able to access any of their assets in the UK. The travel bans mean that the network's leaders will not be able to enter or leave the UK. The prohibition on doing business with Zservers means that UK businesses and individuals will not be able to do business with the network or its members.

**What impact will the sanctions have?**

The sanctions will have a significant impact on Zservers. The asset freezes will make it more difficult for the network to operate and the travel bans will make it more difficult for the network's leaders to communicate with each other. The prohibition on doing business with Zservers will make it more difficult for the network to find new victims.

The sanctions are a significant step in the UK's fight against cybercrime. The sanctions will help to protect businesses and individuals from Zservers' attacks and will make it more difficult for the network to operate.
