## What is password cracking?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/password-cracker)

Published: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 09:00:00 GMT

Password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in a computer system. This can be done by using a variety of techniques, such as brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and rainbow tables.

**Brute-force attacks** try every possible password until the correct one is found. This can be a very time-consuming process, but it is often the only way to crack a password that is not known to the attacker.

**Dictionary attacks** use a list of common words and phrases to try as passwords. This can be a much faster way to crack a password than brute-force attacks, but it is less likely to succeed if the password is not a common word or phrase.

**Rainbow tables** are pre-computed tables that contain the hashes of all possible passwords. This allows attackers to quickly look up the password for a given hash. Rainbow tables are only effective against passwords that are stored as hashes, but they can be very effective in this case.

Password cracking is a serious security risk, as it allows attackers to gain access to sensitive information, such as financial data and personal information. It is important to use strong passwords and to store them securely to protect yourself from this type of attack.

**UK Government Plans to Extend Ransomware Payment Ban**

**London, [Date]**

The UK government has announced plans to extend its ban on ransomware payments, making it illegal for businesses and individuals to pay ransoms to cybercriminals. The move comes in response to a sharp increase in ransomware attacks, which have cost UK organizations millions of pounds in recent years.

The current ban, introduced in May 2023, prohibits businesses and organizations from making payments to ransomware attackers. However, the government is now considering extending the ban to include individuals as well.

**Key Features of the Proposed Extension**

According to the government's plans, the extended ban would:

* Apply to both businesses and individuals
* Make it illegal to pay any ransom or make any other form of payment to ransomware attackers
* Carry a maximum penalty of imprisonment for up to seven years

**Rationale for the Extension**

The government believes that the extension of the ban is necessary to deter ransomware attacks and protect individuals and businesses from the financial and reputational damage associated with paying ransoms.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said: "Ransomware attacks are a serious threat to our national security and our economy. We are determined to make the UK a hostile environment for cybercriminals and protect our citizens and businesses from these despicable attacks."

**Impact on Businesses and Individuals**

The extension of the ban is likely to have a significant impact on businesses and individuals who have been victims of ransomware attacks.

For businesses, it will mean that they will no longer be able to legally pay ransoms to recover their data or systems. This could lead to increased financial losses and reputational damage if they are unable to restore their operations.

For individuals, the ban could make it more difficult to recover their personal data if it is encrypted by ransomware. It is important for individuals to regularly back up their data to minimize the risk of losing it in a ransomware attack.

**Advice for Businesses and Individuals**

The government is urging businesses and individuals to take the following steps to protect themselves from ransomware attacks:

* Use strong cybersecurity measures, including firewalls, anti-malware software, and intrusion detection systems
* Regularly update software and operating systems
* Back up data regularly
* Train employees on ransomware awareness and prevention

**Preparing for AI Regulation: The EU AI Act**

The European Union (EU) is at the forefront of developing comprehensive regulations for artificial intelligence (AI). The EU AI Act, proposed in 2021, seeks to establish a legal framework for the use, development, and deployment of AI systems.

**Scope of the AI Act**

The AI Act covers a wide range of AI applications, including:

* AI systems for safety-critical applications (e.g., autonomous driving)
* AI systems used for biometric identification
* AI systems for detecting and preventing threats to public security
* AI systems used for social scoring or manipulating people's behavior

**Key Provisions**

The AI Act introduces several key provisions to regulate AI, including:

**Risk-Based Approach:**
AI systems are classified into four risk categories based on their potential impact on society and human rights. Different requirements apply to each category.

**Prohibited AI Systems:**
Certain types of AI systems are prohibited, such as those that use subliminal techniques, manipulate people's behavior, or enable mass surveillance.

**Transparency and Accountability:**
Users must be informed when they are interacting with an AI system. Developers must provide information about how the system works and how it was trained.

**Algorithmic Fairness and Non-Discrimination:**
AI systems must be designed to avoid bias and discrimination. Developers must take measures to ensure that the systems are fair and equitable.

**Human Oversight:**
Humans must be involved in the development, deployment, and oversight of high-risk AI systems. This includes having appropriate training and accountability mechanisms.

**Fines and Penalties:**
Violations of the AI Act can result in significant fines or other penalties.

**Implications for Businesses**

The AI Act will have a significant impact on businesses that develop, deploy, or use AI systems. Companies will need to:

* Assess the risks associated with their AI systems
* Implement measures to mitigate these risks
* Ensure compliance with the Act's transparency, fairness, and accountability requirements
* Prepare for potential fines or penalties for non-compliance

**Next Steps**

The AI Act is currently under negotiation in the European Parliament and Council. It is expected to be adopted in 2023 or 2024. Businesses should start preparing now to comply with the Act's requirements. This includes reviewing existing AI systems, developing compliance strategies, and investing in ethical AI development practices.

**Conclusion**

The EU AI Act represents a significant step towards regulating the use of AI in Europe. By establishing clear rules and requirements, the Act aims to promote the responsible development and deployment of AI while protecting fundamental rights and freedoms. Businesses and organizations that operate in the EU must be prepared to comply with the Act to avoid potential penalties and ensure the ethical use of AI.

**US bank FNBO uses Pindrop to tackle voice fraud, deepfakes**

First National Bank of Omaha (FNBO) has deployed Pindrop's Phoneprinting technology to combat voice fraud and deepfake attacks.

Phoneprinting is a patented technology that creates a unique digital fingerprint of a caller's voice and device. This fingerprint is then used to identify and authenticate the caller, making it harder for fraudsters to impersonate legitimate customers.

FNBO is using Phoneprinting to protect its customers from a variety of voice fraud attacks, including account takeover, fraudulent transactions, and identity theft. The technology has been shown to be effective in detecting and preventing fraud, even in cases where the fraudsters are using deepfake technology to impersonate legitimate customers.

"Voice fraud is a growing problem for banks and other financial institutions," said Kevin Ruesch, senior vice president and chief information security officer at FNBO. "Pindrop's Phoneprinting technology gives us a powerful tool to combat this threat and protect our customers."

Pindrop's Phoneprinting technology is a key part of FNBO's broader fraud prevention strategy. The bank also uses a variety of other technologies and processes to protect its customers from fraud, including:

* **Voice biometrics:** Voice biometrics uses voice patterns to identify and authenticate customers. This technology is often used in conjunction with Phoneprinting to provide a more robust level of security.
* **Behavioral analytics:** Behavioral analytics analyzes customer behavior to identify suspicious activity. This technology can be used to detect fraudsters who are attempting to impersonate legitimate customers.
* **Fraud monitoring:** Fraud monitoring systems monitor customer accounts for unusual activity. This technology can be used to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions.

FNBO's commitment to fraud prevention is evident in its use of multiple layers of security to protect its customers. The bank's use of Pindrop's Phoneprinting technology is a key part of this strategy and will help to keep FNBO's customers safe from voice fraud and deepfake attacks.

## Mandiant: Latest Ivanti vulns exploited by Chinese cyber spooks

**Mandiant: Latest Ivanti vulns exploited by Chinese cyber spooks**

Mandiant has warned that Chinese state-sponsored threat actors have exploited recently disclosed vulnerabilities in Ivanti's Pulse Connect Secure (PCS) VPN to target government entities in Asia.

In a threat intelligence advisory published on Thursday, Mandiant said it had observed multiple instances of malicious activity involving the PCS vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2022-41324 and CVE-2022-42889, since March 2023.

The attacks, attributed to a group Mandiant tracks as APT41, involved the exploitation of a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2022-41324) to gain initial access to the targeted PCS VPN appliances, followed by the exploitation of a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2022-42889) to obtain system-level access.

"Mandiant assesses that the threat actors' primary objectives were to establish persistent access to networks, harvest credentials, and exfiltrate sensitive data," the advisory reads.

The targeted organizations, located in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central Asia, primarily belonged to the government sector, including foreign affairs ministries, defense ministries, and law enforcement agencies.

Mandiant also noted that APT41 often exploits vulnerabilities in VPN appliances and software to target organizations in the Asia-Pacific region.

"APT41 has a history of targeting VPNs as an attack vector, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region," the advisory states. "This group has been observed exploiting vulnerabilities in multiple vendor products, including Pulse Secure, Fortinet, and Cisco, to gain initial access to victim networks."

Ivanti released patches for the vulnerabilities in December 2022, and Mandiant urges organizations to apply the updates as soon as possible to mitigate the risk of exploitation.

"Organizations that have not yet patched these vulnerabilities should do so immediately to mitigate the risk of exploitation by APT41 and other threat actors," Mandiant said.
