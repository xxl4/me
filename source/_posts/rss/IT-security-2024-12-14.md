## What is a block cipher?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/block-cipher)

Published: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

A block cipher is a symmetric encryption algorithm that operates on fixed-sized blocks of data, typically 64 or 128 bits in size. It encrypts a block of plaintext into a block of ciphertext of the same size, using a secret key. The key is used to transform the plaintext into the ciphertext, and the same key is used to transform the ciphertext back into the plaintext.

Block ciphers are used in a variety of applications, including:

* Data encryption: Block ciphers can be used to encrypt data at rest or in transit.
* Authentication: Block ciphers can be used to create message authentication codes (MACs), which can be used to verify the integrity of data.
* Key exchange: Block ciphers can be used to create secure key exchange protocols.

Block ciphers are typically implemented using a series of rounds, each of which consists of a series of operations on the data block. The operations typically include:

* Substitution: This operation replaces each bit in the data block with another bit, according to a predetermined substitution table.
* Permutation: This operation rearranges the bits in the data block, according to a predetermined permutation table.
* Rotation: This operation rotates the bits in the data block by a predetermined number of positions.

The number of rounds in a block cipher determines its strength. The more rounds, the stronger the cipher. However, the more rounds, the slower the cipher.

Block ciphers are typically used in conjunction with other cryptographic algorithms, such as hashing algorithms and public-key algorithms.

## What is a stream cipher?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/stream-cipher)

Published: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

A stream cipher is a type of symmetric-key encryption algorithm that operates on a continuous stream of data. Unlike block ciphers, which encrypt data in fixed-size blocks, stream ciphers encrypt data one bit at a time. This makes stream ciphers suitable for encrypting high-speed data streams, such as those found in video and audio applications.

Stream ciphers work by combining a key with a stream of data to produce a ciphertext stream. The key is typically a long, random sequence of bits, and the stream of data is the plaintext that is to be encrypted. The encryption process is controlled by a keystream generator, which is a function that produces a stream of pseudorandom bits. The keystream generator is initialised with the key, and it then produces a continuous stream of bits that are used to encrypt the plaintext.

The ciphertext stream is generated by XORing the plaintext stream with the keystream stream. This produces a stream of ciphertext bits that is indistinguishable from a random sequence of bits. The decryption process is simply the reverse of the encryption process. The ciphertext stream is XORed with the keystream stream to produce the plaintext stream.

Stream ciphers are typically much faster than block ciphers, as they do not need to buffer large blocks of data. However, they are also generally less secure than block ciphers, as the keystream generator can be vulnerable to attack.

## What is cipher block chaining (CBC)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/cipher-block-chaining)

Published: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)** is a block cipher mode of operation that utilizes a chaining mechanism to provide confidentiality and integrity to data.

**How CBC Works:**

1. **Initialization Vector (IV):** Before encrypting the first block, a random value called the Initialization Vector (IV) is prepended to the plaintext.
2. **Exclusive OR (XOR):** Each plaintext block is XORed (bitwise exclusive OR) with the previous ciphertext block. The result of the XOR is then encrypted by the block cipher.
3. **Encryption:** The encrypted result from step 2 becomes the ciphertext block.
4. **Chaining:** The ciphertext block from the previous iteration is used as the XOR input for the next plaintext block.
5. **Iteration:** This process continues for all subsequent plaintext blocks.

**Advantages of CBC:**

* **Confidentiality:** CBC ensures that each ciphertext block depends on the previous ciphertext block, making it harder for attackers to guess the plaintext without knowing the previous ciphertext.
* **Integrity:** Any modification to a plaintext or ciphertext block will propagate through the subsequent blocks, alerting the receiver to potential tampering.
* **Initialization Vector:** The IV randomizes the encryption process, making it harder for attackers to detect patterns in the ciphertext.

**Disadvantages of CBC:**

* **Initialization Dependency:** The first ciphertext block is IV-dependent, which could lead to vulnerabilities if the IV is predictable.
* **Serialization:** CBC requires the encryption or decryption of data to be done sequentially, block by block. This can be less efficient than other modes such as Counter (CTR) mode for parallelization.

**Applications of CBC:**

CBC is widely used in various cryptographic applications, including:

* **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**
* **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**
* **Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)**
* **Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)**

User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It is typically done by asking the user to enter a username and password, but other methods can also be used, such as biometrics (e.g., fingerprint scanning) or security tokens.

User authentication is important because it helps to protect data and resources from unauthorized access. By verifying the identity of a user, a system can ensure that only authorized users are able to access certain information or perform certain actions.

There are a number of different user authentication methods that can be used, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The most common method is username and password authentication, which is simple to implement and use. However, username and password authentication can be vulnerable to attack, as users may choose weak passwords or reuse passwords across multiple accounts.

Other user authentication methods include:

* Biometrics (e.g., fingerprint scanning, facial recognition)
* Security tokens (e.g., smart cards, USB keys)
* Two-factor authentication (e.g., requiring a username and password as well as a code sent to a mobile phone)

The choice of user authentication method depends on the level of security required and the user's preferences.

## Bahrain faces legal action after planting Pegasus spyware on UK blogger

**Bahrain Faces Legal Action After Planting Pegasus Spyware on UK Blogger**

**Manama, Bahrain:** Bahrain is facing legal action in the United Kingdom after it was alleged that the government planted Pegasus spyware on the phone of a British blogger. The blogger, Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, is a prominent human rights activist who has been critical of the Bahraini government.

**Allegations of Surveillance**

According to Amnesty International, Pegasus spyware was found on Alwadaei's phone in 2020. The spyware allowed the Bahraini government to remotely access his communications, including text messages, emails, and phone calls.

Alwadaei claims that the surveillance was politically motivated and aimed at silencing his criticism of the government. He has been a vocal advocate for human rights in Bahrain, where political dissent is often suppressed.

**Legal Action Initiated**

In response to the allegations, Alwadaei has initiated legal action against the Bahraini government in the UK. He is represented by the international law firm Doughty Street Chambers.

The lawsuit alleges that the government violated Alwadaei's human rights, including his right to privacy, freedom of expression, and freedom from arbitrary interference. It seeks compensation for damages and an injunction to prevent further surveillance.

**Bahrain's Denial**

The Bahraini government has denied the allegations of surveillance. It has not commented on the legal action initiated by Alwadaei.

However, Bahrain has been accused of using Pegasus spyware to target other dissidents in the past. In 2019, Amnesty International reported that Pegasus was found on the phones of at least 14 Bahraini activists, including Alwadaei.

**Implications for Bahrain**

The legal action against Bahrain could have significant implications for the country's international reputation. It raises concerns about the government's commitment to human rights and could lead to sanctions or diplomatic isolation.

The case also highlights the growing use of Pegasus spyware by governments around the world. Pegasus has been linked to violations of human rights in multiple countries, including Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.

The legal battle between Alwadaei and the Bahraini government is likely to be a test case for international efforts to regulate the use of surveillance technologies.

## Six trends that will define cyber through to 2030

Published: Fri, 06 Dec 2024 16:45:00 GMT

**1. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI)**

AI will continue to play an increasingly important role in cybersecurity. AI-powered security tools can help organizations to detect and respond to threats more quickly and effectively. They can also be used to automate many of the tasks that are currently performed by human security analysts, freeing up those analysts to focus on more strategic initiatives.

**2. The convergence of physical and cyber security**

The lines between physical and cyber security are becoming increasingly blurred. This is due in part to the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), which is connecting more and more devices to the internet. These devices can be used to collect data that can be used to target cyberattacks, or they can be used to launch cyberattacks themselves.

**3. The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks**

Cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect. This is due in part to the rise of artificial intelligence, which is being used by attackers to develop new and more effective attack methods.

**4. The growth of cybercrime**

Cybercrime is a major threat to organizations of all sizes. Cybercriminals are using a variety of methods to steal data, money, and other valuable assets.

**5. The rise of nation-state attacks**

Nation-state attacks are a growing threat to organizations of all sizes. These attacks are often carried out by government-sponsored hackers who are seeking to steal secrets, disrupt critical infrastructure, or influence public opinion.

**6. The need for greater cybersecurity collaboration**

Organizations need to work together to improve cybersecurity. This includes sharing information about threats and best practices, and working together to develop new security solutions.

## US TikTok ban imminent after appeal fails

**US TikTok Ban Imminent After Appeal Fails**

A US federal appeals court has upheld a lower court ruling that the Trump administration's TikTok ban can remain in effect. The decision casts doubt on the future of TikTok's operations in the United States.

**Background of the Ban**

In August 2020, the Trump administration issued an executive order that banned TikTok and WeChat from operating in the United States, citing national security concerns. The order was based on claims that the apps could be used by the Chinese government to gather sensitive data on American users.

**Legal Challenges**

TikTok and WeChat challenged the ban in court, arguing that it violated their First Amendment rights. A federal judge initially blocked the ban, but the Trump administration appealed.

**Appeals Court Ruling**

On Monday, December 14, 2020, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's ruling that the ban can remain in effect. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of the ban but instead found that the Trump administration had provided sufficient evidence to support its national security concerns.

**Implications for TikTok**

The appeals court ruling is a major setback for TikTok. The company has argued that it is not controlled by the Chinese government and that its operations in the United States are secure. However, the court's decision suggests that the Trump administration's concerns outweigh any constitutional concerns raised by the ban.

**Possible Next Steps**

TikTok could appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, but there is no guarantee that the court will agree to hear the case. Another possibility is that the Biden administration will reverse the ban. However, President-elect Biden has not yet commented on the issue.

**Impact on US Users**

If the ban remains in effect, it will prevent US users from downloading or updating the TikTok app. Existing users will still be able to access the app, but they may face restrictions on its use.

**Transport for London (TfL) cyber attack cost over Â£30m to date**

The cyber attack on Transport for London (TfL) in August 2022 has cost the organisation over Â£30m to date, according to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request.

The attack, which was carried out by a ransomware gang, encrypted TfL's systems and caused widespread disruption to the network. TfL was forced to close down the Tube and other services for several days, and the full cost of the attack is still being calculated.

The FOI request, which was submitted by the BBC, revealed that TfL has spent Â£20m on cyber security measures since the attack, and a further Â£10m on other costs, such as legal fees and compensation for customers.

TfL has said that the attack was "a significant challenge", but that it has now "restored all of our critical systems and put in place a number of additional measures to improve our cyber security".

The attack on TfL is a reminder of the growing threat of cyber attacks on critical infrastructure. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile attacks on organisations such as the NHS, the US power grid, and the German government.

TfL's experience shows that even the most well-prepared organisations can be targeted by cyber attacks. It is important for organisations to invest in cyber security measures and to have a plan in place for responding to an attack.
