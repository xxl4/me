## What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/two-factor-authentication)

Published: Mon, 28 Oct 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires users to provide two different factors of authentication to confirm their identity when logging in to an account. The two factors are typically:

* **Something you know:** This could be a password, PIN, or other secret information that only the user knows.
* **Something you have:** This could be a physical device, such as a phone or token, that is in the user's possession.

When a user logs in to an account with 2FA enabled, they will be prompted to enter both their password and the verification code that is sent to their phone or generated by their token. This makes it much more difficult for an attacker to gain access to the account, even if they have the user's password.

2FA is a simple and effective way to improve the security of your online accounts. It is recommended that you enable 2FA on all of your important accounts, such as your email, banking, and social media accounts.

Published: Fri, 11 Oct 2024 13:26:00 GMT

**Robust Cloud IAM Aligned with Zero-Trust Principles**

**Zero-Trust Principles:**

* Assume breach: Trust no one, both inside and outside the organization.
* Verify explicitly: Always authenticate and authorize before granting access.
* Use least privilege: Grant only the access necessary to perform specific tasks.

**IAM Alignment with Zero-Trust:**

**1. Least Privilege:**

* Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to assign granular permissions based on job functions.
* Use principle of least privilege to limit access to only what is absolutely necessary.

**2. Strong Authentication:**

* Configure multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all cloud users.
* Use strong passwords and enforce complexity requirements.
* Implement single sign-on (SSO) to reduce password fatigue and potential breaches.

**3. Continuous Monitoring and Logging:**

* Enable logging for all IAM activity, including access attempts and permission changes.
* Monitor logs for suspicious behavior or unauthorized access.
* Implement anomaly detection to identify deviations from expected access patterns.

**4. Identity Federation:**

* Integrate with external identity providers (IDPs) using SAML or OAuth.
* Manage identities centrally in an external directory, ensuring consistent access controls.

**5. Assume Breach Mindset:**

* Assume that unauthorized access has already occurred and monitor for potential threats.
* Conduct regular risk assessments and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
* Implement threat detection and response mechanisms to mitigate breaches.

**6. Just-in-Time (JIT) Access:**

* Grant access to resources only when necessary and for a limited duration.
* Use time-bound tokens or ephemeral credentials to restrict access to short-lived sessions.

**Benefits of Zero-Trust IAM:**

* Enhanced security posture by eliminating trust-based environments.
* Reduced risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
* Improved compliance with regulatory standards.
* Granular control over user access and permissions.
* Reduced administrative overhead for managing access.

**Conclusion:**

Robust cloud IAM should align with zero-trust principles by implementing least privilege, strong authentication, continuous monitoring, identity federation, assuming a breach mindset, and adopting JIT access. This comprehensive approach enhances security, reduces risk, and ensures compliance with industry best practices.

Published: Thu, 10 Oct 2024 12:00:00 GMT

Threat intelligence is the continuous process of collecting, analyzing, and sharing information on potential threats to an organization's assets. This information can be used to predict and mitigate attacks, reduce the impact of security breaches, and improve overall security posture.

Threat intelligence can come from a variety of sources, including public reports, government agencies, law enforcement, and private threat intelligence firms. It can be collected using a variety of methods, including open-source intelligence (OSINT), closed-source intelligence (CSINT), and human intelligence (HUMINT).

Once threat intelligence has been collected, it must be analyzed to identify potential threats to an organization's assets. This analysis can be done using a variety of methods, including manual analysis, automated analysis, and machine learning.

The results of threat intelligence analysis can be used to create threat profiles, which describe the potential threats to an organization's assets, including the likelihood and impact of each threat. Threat profiles can be used to develop security measures to mitigate the risks posed by each threat.

Threat intelligence is an essential part of a comprehensive security program. By understanding the potential threats to their assets, organizations can take steps to protect themselves from those threats.
