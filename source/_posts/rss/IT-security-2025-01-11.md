**Mandiant: Latest Ivanti vulns exploited by Chinese cyber spooks**

* **Mandiant attributes attacks to "APT41," a Chinese state-sponsored group.**
* **APT41 has been exploiting recently disclosed vulnerabilities in Ivanti's Pulse Connect Secure VPN appliances.**
* **The attacks are targeting government and private sector organizations worldwide.**

Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm, has attributed recent attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in Ivanti's Pulse Connect Secure VPN appliances to a Chinese state-sponsored cyber espionage group known as "APT41."

According to Mandiant's report, APT41 has been actively targeting government and private sector organizations worldwide, using the vulnerabilities to gain access to their networks and steal sensitive information.

The vulnerabilities in question were disclosed by Ivanti in April 2023. They allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable appliances, effectively giving them full control over the devices.

Mandiant said that APT41 has been exploiting these vulnerabilities since at least May 2023. The group has been using a variety of techniques to gain access to vulnerable appliances, including phishing emails, watering hole attacks, and drive-by downloads.

Once attackers have gained access to a vulnerable appliance, they can use it to launch a variety of attacks, including stealing data, deploying malware, and establishing persistent access to the victim's network.

Mandiant said that APT41 has been targeting a wide range of organizations, including government agencies, financial institutions, and healthcare providers. The group is known to be particularly interested in stealing intellectual property and sensitive data.

The attacks underscore the importance of patching vulnerabilities promptly. Organizations that are using Ivanti's Pulse Connect Secure VPN appliances should apply the patches that Ivanti has released as soon as possible.

Mandiant also recommends that organizations implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect their VPNs from unauthorized access. MFA requires users to provide two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate, which makes it much more difficult for attackers to compromise accounts.

## Saudi Arabia calls for humanitarian AI after tightening screws on rights protesters
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366617701/Saudi-Arabia-calls-for-humanitarian-AI-after-tightening-screws-on-rights-protesters)

Published: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 08:15:00 GMT

Saudi Arabia has called for the development of humanitarian artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, even as it continues to crack down on human rights protesters.

The kingdom's Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) announced the launch of a new initiative called the "Humanitarian AI Challenge," which will award grants to researchers and developers working on AI solutions to global humanitarian challenges.

The MCIT said the initiative is part of its commitment to "harnessing the power of technology for good," and that it believes AI can play a vital role in addressing "some of the world's most pressing humanitarian challenges."

However, the announcement of the Humanitarian AI Challenge has been met with skepticism by some human rights groups, who point out that Saudi Arabia has a long history of suppressing dissent and cracking down on human rights activists.

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has arrested and imprisoned dozens of human rights defenders, including women's rights activists, journalists, and academics. The kingdom has also been accused of torturing and mistreating political prisoners.

"Saudi Arabia's call for humanitarian AI is nothing more than a PR stunt," said Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi human rights activist who lives in exile. "The kingdom has a terrible human rights record, and it is using AI to further suppress dissent."

Abdulaziz pointed to the case of Loujain al-Hathloul, a prominent women's rights activist who was arrested in 2018 and has been tortured and sexually harassed in prison.

"If Saudi Arabia was serious about using AI for good, it would release Loujain and all other political prisoners," Abdulaziz said.

The launch of the Humanitarian AI Challenge comes just weeks after Saudi Arabia announced new restrictions on freedom of expression. The new regulations make it illegal to "disseminate false or misleading information" or to "harm the reputation of the kingdom."

The new restrictions have been condemned by human rights groups, who say they will further stifle dissent and make it even more difficult for activists to speak out against the government.

"Saudi Arabia's new restrictions on freedom of expression are a clear sign that the kingdom is not interested in improving its human rights record," said Sarah Leah Whitson, the Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. "The Humanitarian AI Challenge is just a way for the kingdom to whitewash its image and pretend that it is a champion of human rights."

## What is a public key and how does it work?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key)

Published: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Public Key**

A public key is an encryption key that is made public and can be distributed to anyone. It can be used to encrypt messages, but cannot decrypt them. The corresponding decryption key is known as the private key and is kept secret.

**How It Works:**

The process of public-key cryptography involves the following steps:

**1. Generate Key Pair:**
* Two mathematically related keys are generated: a public key and a private key.

**2. Publishing the Public Key:**
* The public key is made publicly available, while the private key is kept secret.

**3. Encryption:**
* A sender encrypts a message using the recipient's public key.
* This encryption process makes the message unreadable to anyone who does not have the private key.

**4. Decryption:**
* The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the message.
* As only the recipient has access to the private key, they are the only ones who can read the decrypted message.

**Key Features:**

* **Confidentiality:** Public-key cryptography ensures that messages can only be read by the intended recipient, providing confidentiality.
* **Authentication:** If a recipient responds to a message using their private key, it verifies their identity and authenticates them as the originator of the response.
* **Non-repudiation:** Since the sender encrypts the message with the recipient's public key, the recipient cannot deny receiving the message.

**Applications:**

Public-key cryptography is widely used in:

* Secure email (e.g., PGP)
* Digital signatures
* SSL/TLS protocols for secure website communication
* Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
* Authentication and identity verification systems

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/proxy-firewall)

Published: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Definition:**

A proxy firewall is a network security appliance that acts as an intermediary between trusted and untrusted networks. It filters network traffic passing between these networks, enforcing security policies and protecting internal resources from external threats.

**How it Works:**

* Proxy firewalls act as a "middleman" between clients on the internal network and servers on the external network.
* Clients connect to the proxy firewall, which then establishes connections to the external servers on their behalf.
* The proxy firewall intercepts all traffic passing through it and inspects it for malicious content, unauthorized access attempts, and policy violations.

**Features:**

* **Stateful Inspection:** Proxy firewalls monitor the state of network connections and make decisions based on the history of traffic.
* **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** They use ACLs to define rules for which traffic is allowed and which is blocked.
* **Content Filtering:** They can filter traffic based on specific content, such as file types, URLs, or keywords.
* **Protocol Inspection:** They can inspect specific protocols, such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, to detect vulnerabilities and block malicious requests.
* **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** Some proxy firewalls include IPS capabilities to detect and block known network attacks.

**Benefits:**

* **Enhanced Security:** Proxy firewalls provide an additional layer of security, protecting internal networks from external threats and data breaches.
* **Centralized Control:** They allow administrators to manage security policies from a single location, making it easier to implement and enforce consistent security measures.
* **Improved Performance:** By caching frequently accessed content, proxy firewalls can improve network performance for clients.
* **Anonymity:** Proxies can hide the real IP addresses of clients, providing a degree of anonymity when accessing external networks.

**Considerations:**

* **Cost:** Proxy firewalls can be more expensive than traditional firewalls.
* **Performance:** Inspecting traffic can introduce latency into the network.
* **Configuration Complexity:** Proxy firewalls require careful configuration to ensure that they do not block legitimate traffic.

A French court has rejected a request to expedite the trial of Thomas Herdman, a key distributor of the encrypted communications platform Sky ECC. Herdman was arrested in January 2021 and charged with complicity in drug trafficking and money laundering.

**Background**

Sky ECC was a secure messaging app that gained popularity among criminal organizations due to its strong encryption. In March 2021, law enforcement agencies in Europe and the United States cracked the Sky ECC encryption, leading to the arrest of thousands of individuals worldwide.

Herdman is accused of distributing Sky ECC devices and services to criminal groups in the United Kingdom and other countries. Prosecutors allege that he played a significant role in facilitating drug trafficking and other illegal activities.

**Request for Expedited Trial**

Herdman's lawyers requested that his trial be expedited due to the length of time he has spent in pre-trial detention. They argued that the delay was causing him undue suffering and that he had the right to a fair and speedy trial.

**Court's Decision**

However, the French court rejected the request for an expedited trial. The court noted that the case was complex and required careful investigation and preparation. The court also considered the need to protect the rights of other parties involved in the case.
