**Government Hails Cyber Essentials Success**

The government has praised the success of the Cyber Essentials scheme, which has helped over 23,000 businesses protect themselves against cyber-attacks.

Cyber Essentials is a government-backed certification scheme that helps businesses of all sizes to improve their cybersecurity. It provides guidance on how to protect against common cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and hacking.

Since its launch in 2014, Cyber Essentials has become the de facto standard for cybersecurity in the UK. Over 23,000 businesses have now achieved the certification, including major organizations such as the BBC, HSBC, and the National Grid.

The government has hailed the success of Cyber Essentials, saying that it has helped to make the UK a safer place to do business online.

"Cyber Essentials is a vital part of our national cybersecurity strategy," said Digital Minister Margot James. "It has helped to raise the bar for cybersecurity in the UK and has made a real difference in protecting businesses from online threats."

The government is now encouraging more businesses to sign up to Cyber Essentials. The scheme is free to join and can be completed in a matter of weeks.

"I urge all businesses to take advantage of Cyber Essentials," said James. "It is a simple and effective way to protect your business from cyber-attacks."

**Benefits of Cyber Essentials**

There are many benefits to achieving Cyber Essentials certification, including:

* Improved cybersecurity protection
* Reduced risk of cyber-attacks
* Increased customer confidence
* Improved reputation
* Compliance with government and industry regulations

**How to Achieve Cyber Essentials**

To achieve Cyber Essentials certification, businesses must demonstrate that they have implemented the five key security controls:

1. Firewalls and intrusion detection systems
2. Secure configuration
3. Access control
4. Malware protection
5. Patch management

Businesses can achieve Cyber Essentials certification by self-assessing against the five key security controls or by using a Certified Cyber Essentials Assessor.

Published: Wed, 23 Oct 2024 09:52:00 GMT

**Using Google Cloud Storage Object Lifecycle Management and Incident Response Functions**

**1. Configure Object Lifecycle Management (OLM)**

* **Rule 1:** Archive old objects (e.g., 90 days inactive) to a cheaper storage class like Coldline.
* **Rule 2:** Delete objects after an extended period (e.g., 365 days inactive) to prevent data retention beyond its lifecycle.

**2. Create Incident Response Functions**

* **Early Detection:** Define a function that scans objects in the archive bucket for known ransomware signatures or suspicious file extensions.
* **Rapid Response:** Design a function to quarantine or delete infected objects and notify the security team.

**Process Flow:**

1. OLM archives old objects to the Coldline bucket.
2. Early Detection function scans the Coldline bucket for ransomware indicators.
3. If ransomware is detected, the Rapid Response function is triggered.
4. The Rapid Response function quarantines or deletes infected objects and sends an alert to the security team.

**Benefits:**

* **Early detection:** OLM allows for rapid scanning of old objects, increasing the chances of catching ransomware early.
* **Automatic response:** Incident response functions automate the quarantine/deletion process, reducing manual intervention and minimizing the spread of ransomware.
* **Cost savings:** Archiving old objects to a cheaper storage class saves storage costs.
* **Compliance:** Helps meet data retention and cybersecurity regulations.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Use a cloud storage security scanner like Cloud Data Loss Prevention for additional file inspection.
* Integrate with other security tools like SIEM or EDR for comprehensive incident response.
* Regularly test and update detection and response mechanisms to stay ahead of evolving ransomware threats.
