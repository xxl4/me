[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/block-cipher)

Published: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

A block cipher is a deterministic algorithm that operates on fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks. It takes a block of plaintext as input and produces a block of ciphertext as output. The same plaintext block will always produce the same ciphertext block when encrypted with the same key.

Block ciphers are used in a wide variety of applications, including:

* Data encryption: Block ciphers are used to encrypt data at rest, such as files on a hard drive or data in a database.
* Secure communications: Block ciphers are used to encrypt data in transit, such as emails or messages sent over a network.
* Authentication: Block ciphers can be used to create digital signatures, which can be used to authenticate the identity of a user or the integrity of a message.

Block ciphers are typically symmetric, meaning that the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data. However, there are also asymmetric block ciphers, which use different keys for encryption and decryption.

The strength of a block cipher is determined by the length of the key and the algorithm used. The longer the key, the more difficult it is to break the cipher. The algorithm used also affects the strength of the cipher, with some algorithms being more resistant to attack than others.

Some common block ciphers include:

* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
* DES (Data Encryption Standard)
* 3DES (Triple DES)
* Blowfish
* Twofish

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/stream-cipher)

Published: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

A stream cipher is a type of symmetric-key encryption algorithm that operates on a continuous stream of data, encrypting it bit by bit or byte by byte. In contrast, a block cipher encrypts data in fixed-size blocks.

Stream ciphers are typically used to encrypt network traffic, as they can operate continuously without the need to buffer data. They are also used in applications where the data to be encrypted is very large, as stream ciphers can handle large amounts of data efficiently.

There are several different types of stream ciphers, including:

* Linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs)
* Non-linear feedback shift registers (NLFSRs)
* Clock-controlled shift registers (CCSRs)
* Grain-128a
* Salsa20

Each type of stream cipher has its own advantages and disadvantages. LFSRs are simple to implement and can be very fast, but they can be vulnerable to certain types of attacks. NLFSRs are more complex than LFSRs, but they are also more resistant to attacks. CCSRs are a type of stream cipher that uses a clock to control the shift of the registers. This makes them more difficult to attack, but also more complex to implement. Grain-128a and Salsa20 are two of the most widely used stream ciphers today. They are both fast, secure, and easy to implement.

Stream ciphers are an important tool for securing data. They are widely used in a variety of applications, including network security, data storage, and financial transactions.

## What is cipher block chaining (CBC)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/cipher-block-chaining)

Published: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)** is a block cipher mode of operation that uses a feedback mechanism to encrypt successive blocks of data. It is widely used in various encryption applications, such as securing data transfers and disk encryption.

**How CBC Works:**

1. The plaintext is divided into blocks of fixed size (e.g., 128 bits).
2. An **Initialization Vector (IV)** is randomly generated. The IV is used to initialize the feedback mechanism.
3. The first plaintext block is XORed with the IV and then encrypted using the block cipher.
4. For subsequent plaintext blocks, the previous ciphertext block is XORed with the plaintext block before encryption.
5. The resulting ciphertext block is the output for the current block.
6. This process repeats for all plaintext blocks.

**Illustration:**

```
Plaintext: A B C D E F G H
IV: 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1

Encrypted Block 1 (E(A XOR 1)): B' C' D'
Encrypted Block 2 (E(B' XOR B)): C'' D'' E'
Encrypted Block 3 (E(C'' XOR C)): D''' E'' F'
```

**Advantages of CBC:**

* **Confidentiality:** CBC conceals the plaintext by encrypting each plaintext block with the previous ciphertext block, making it difficult to recover plaintext from intercepted ciphertext.
* **Integrity:** Any modification to a plaintext block will cause a ripple effect on subsequent ciphertext blocks, making it easy to detect data tampering.
* **Random Access:** CBC allows random access to ciphertext blocks, which is useful for applications that need to modify specific parts of encrypted data.

**Disadvantages of CBC:**

* **IV Attack:** If the IV is not properly generated or managed, it can be used to break the encryption.
* **Error Propagation:** Errors in one ciphertext block can propagate to subsequent blocks, potentially corrupting the entire decrypted message.
* **Performance Overhead:** CBC requires additional operations (IV generation and XORing) compared to other block cipher modes.

**TfL cyber attack cost over Â£30m to date**

The cyber attack on Transport for London (TfL) in August 2022 has cost the organisation over Â£30m to date, according to a report by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).

The PAC report, published on 14 February 2023, found that TfL was "not adequately prepared" for the attack and that its response was "inadequate". The report also criticised TfL for not having a clear plan in place to deal with a cyber attack and for failing to communicate effectively with the public during the incident.

The cyber attack, which began on 11 August 2022, targeted TfL's IT systems and caused widespread disruption to the capital's transport network. TfL was forced to close down some of its services, including the London Underground and the DLR, and was forced to implement new security measures to protect its systems.

The PAC report found that TfL had failed to take a number of steps to prepare for a cyber attack, including:

* Not having a clear plan in place to deal with a cyber attack
* Not having a clear understanding of its risks from cyber attacks
* Not having adequate security measures in place to protect its systems
* Not having a clear communication strategy in place to deal with a cyber attack

The PAC report also found that TfL's response to the attack was "inadequate" and that it "failed to communicate effectively with the public during the incident". The report said that TfL "did not provide clear and timely information to the public about the attack and its impact on services" and that "the information that was provided was often inaccurate or incomplete".

The PAC report concluded that TfL "needs to take urgent action to improve its cyber security and to ensure that it is better prepared for a future cyber attack". The report recommended that TfL take a number of steps to improve its cyber security, including:

* Developing a clear plan to deal with a cyber attack
* Conducting a full risk assessment of its cyber security risks
* Implementing robust security measures to protect its systems
* Developing a clear communication strategy to deal with a cyber attack

TfL has said that it is "working hard" to improve its cyber security and that it is "committed to learning from the experience of the August 2022 cyber attack". TfL said that it has already taken a number of steps to improve its cyber security, including:

* Developing a new cyber security strategy
* Appointing a new Chief Information Security Officer
* Investing in new security measures
* Developing a new training program for staff on cyber security

TfL said that it is "confident" that it is "better prepared for a future cyber attack" and that it is "committed to providing a safe and secure transport network for the people of London".

The CC provides a standardized framework for evaluating the security of IT products and systems, which helps to ensure that:

* Evaluations are conducted in a consistent and objective manner
* The results of evaluations are comparable and reliable
* Organizations can make informed decisions about the security of the products and systems they purchase

**Structure of the CC**

The CC is divided into three parts:

* **Part 1: Introduction and General Model** - This part provides an overview of the CC and the evaluation process. It also defines the terms and concepts that are used in the CC.
* **Part 2: Security Functional Components** - This part provides a catalog of security functional components that can be used to evaluate the security of IT products and systems. These components are organized into 11 different classes, each of which represents a different aspect of security.
* **Part 3: Security Assurance Components** - This part provides a catalog of security assurance components that can be used to evaluate the confidence that can be placed in the security of IT products and systems. These components are organized into four different classes, each of which represents a different level of assurance.

**Use of the CC**

The CC is used by a variety of organizations, including:

* Government agencies
* Financial institutions
* Healthcare organizations
* Telecommunications companies
* Technology vendors

These organizations use the CC to evaluate the security of IT products and systems that they purchase and use. The CC can also be used by organizations to develop their own security requirements and to assess the security of their own IT systems.

**Benefits of Using the CC**

There are several benefits to using the CC, including:

* **Increased confidence in the security of IT products and systems** - The CC provides a rigorous and comprehensive framework for evaluating the security of IT products and systems. This helps organizations to make informed decisions about the security of the products and systems they purchase and use.
* **Reduced risk of data breaches and other security incidents** - The CC helps organizations to identify and mitigate security risks. This can help to reduce the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.
* **Improved compliance with regulations** - The CC can help organizations to comply with regulations that require them to evaluate the security of their IT systems.

**Conclusion**

The CC is a valuable tool for evaluating the security of IT products and systems. It provides a standardized framework for conducting evaluations, and helps organizations to make informed decisions about the security of the products and systems they purchase.
