[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/block-cipher)

Published: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

A block cipher is a deterministic encryption algorithm that operates on fixed-size groups of bits, called blocks. Block ciphers are a fundamental building block in modern cryptography and are used in a wide variety of applications, including:

- Data encryption: Block ciphers are used to encrypt data before it is stored or transmitted over a network. This ensures that the data is protected from unauthorized access.
- Authentication: Block ciphers can be used to authenticate data by creating a message authentication code (MAC). A MAC is a short piece of data that is generated by a block cipher and is used to verify the integrity of a message.
- Key exchange: Block ciphers can be used to securely exchange cryptographic keys between two parties. This is done by using a key agreement protocol, which involves the exchange of encrypted messages between the two parties.

Block ciphers are typically symmetric, meaning that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. However, there are also asymmetric block ciphers, which use different keys for encryption and decryption.

The security of a block cipher is determined by a number of factors, including the key size, the block size, and the number of rounds. The key size is the length of the key used to encrypt the data. The block size is the size of the blocks of data that are encrypted. The number of rounds refers to the number of times that the data is passed through the encryption algorithm.

The most common type of block cipher is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is a symmetric block cipher with a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits and a block size of 128 bits. AES is used in a wide variety of applications, including data encryption, authentication, and key exchange.

## What is a stream cipher?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/stream-cipher)

Published: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

A stream cipher is a symmetric-key cipher that processes plaintext one byte at a time, producing a ciphertext stream that is the same length as the plaintext. Stream ciphers are typically faster than block ciphers, but they are not as secure.

Stream ciphers are often used in applications where speed is more important than security, such as in streaming video and audio. They are also used in some cryptographic protocols, such as SSL/TLS and SSH.

There are many different types of stream ciphers, but they all share some common characteristics. First, they all use a key to generate a pseudorandom sequence of bits. This sequence is then combined with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. Second, stream ciphers are typically implemented using a feedback loop. This means that the output of the cipher is fed back into the input, which helps to make the cipher more difficult to break.

Some of the most common stream ciphers include:

* RC4
* Salsa20
* ChaCha20
* AES-CTR

Stream ciphers are an important part of modern cryptography. They offer a good balance of speed and security, making them ideal for a wide range of applications.

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/user-authentication)

Published: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

User authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity and determining whether they are authorized to access a particular system or resource. This process is typically done by requiring a user to enter a username and password, which are compared against a database of stored credentials. If the username and password match, the user is authenticated and granted access.

The purpose of user authentication is to protect systems and resources from unauthorized access. By requiring users to authenticate their identity, organizations can ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data and applications.

User authentication is also essential for security in the internet age. As more and more of our personal and financial information is stored online, it is important to have strong authentication measures in place to protect our accounts from being hacked.

There are several different types of user authentication methods, including:

* **Password authentication:** This is the most common type of user authentication, and it requires a user to enter a password to verify their identity. Password authentication is relatively easy to implement and use, but it can be difficult to remember long and complex passwords.
* **Two-factor authentication:** This type of authentication requires a user to enter a password and a second factor, such as a one-time passcode sent via text message or email. Two-factor authentication provides an additional layer of security beyond password authentication, as it makes it more difficult for attackers to access accounts even if they have the password.
* **Biometric authentication:** This type of authentication uses a unique physical characteristic, such as a fingerprint or iris scan, to verify a user's identity. Biometric authentication is considered more secure than password authentication, as it is difficult to replicate or forge a physical characteristic.

The appropriate user authentication method for an organization will depend on their security needs and the level of risk they are willing to accept.

## What is a session key?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/session-key)

Published: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

A session key is a temporary key that is used to encrypt and decrypt communication between two or more parties. It is typically used for the duration of a single session or transaction, and is then discarded. Session keys are often generated using a key exchange protocol, such as Diffie-Hellman or RSA.

The main advantage of using session keys is that they provide forward secrecy. This means that if an attacker is able to compromise a session key, they will not be able to decrypt any previous or future communications that were encrypted using that key. This is in contrast to long-term keys, which can be used to encrypt and decrypt multiple communications over a long period of time. If an attacker is able to compromise a long-term key, they will be able to decrypt all communications that were encrypted using that key.

Session keys are used in a variety of applications, including secure messaging, VPNs, and SSL/TLS.

## What is cipher block chaining (CBC)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/cipher-block-chaining)

Published: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)** is a block cipher mode of operation that uses the output of previous blocks to encrypt subsequent blocks. It provides confidentiality and integrity for data transmissions.

**How CBC Works:**

1. **Initialization:** A random **Initialization Vector (IV)** is generated and used as the plaintext for the first block.
2. **Encryption:** Each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted with the block cipher.
3. **Decryption:** Each ciphertext block is decrypted with the block cipher, and the result is XORed with the previous ciphertext block to recover the plaintext.

**Purpose of CBC:**

* **Confidentiality:** CBC ensures that plaintext is encrypted differently each time, even if the same plaintext appears multiple times in a message.
* **Integrity:** Any unauthorized modification to a ciphertext block will result in a different plaintext than intended, making it easy to detect tampering.
* **Increased Strength:** CBC mode provides stronger security than ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode, which uses the same encryption key for all blocks.

**Advantages of CBC:**

* **Variable Length Data:** Can be used to encrypt data of any length.
* **Error Propagation:** Any bit error in a ciphertext block will only affect the recovery of that block and the following blocks.
* **Initialization Vector (IV):** Uses an IV to ensure that each encrypted message is unique, even if the plaintext is the same.

**Disadvantages of CBC:**

* **Latency:** Requires the transmission or storage of the IV for decryption.
* **Sequential Processing:** Encryption and decryption must be done sequentially, block by block.
* **Padding Required:** Plaintext must be padded to a multiple of the block size for encryption.

**Applications:**

CBC mode is widely used in various applications, including:

* **Secure File Transfer:** TLS/SSL protocols
* **Database Encryption:** e.g., SQLite
* **Block Device Encryption:** e.g., TrueCrypt, LUKS
* **Secure Messaging:** e.g., OpenPGP, S/MIME

## US TikTok ban imminent after appeal fails
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366616902/US-TikTok-ban-imminent-after-appeal-fails)

Published: Fri, 06 Dec 2024 14:38:00 GMT

**US TikTok Ban Imminent After Appeal Fails**

The Trump administration's ban on the popular Chinese-owned app TikTok is set to go into effect on September 20th after an appeal by the app's parent company, ByteDance, was rejected by a federal judge.

The ban prohibits US companies from doing business with TikTok. This would effectively shut down the app in the United States, as TikTok relies on US-based servers and infrastructure to operate.

ByteDance had argued that the ban was unconstitutional and would violate the free speech rights of TikTok users. However, the judge found that the government had a legitimate interest in protecting national security and that the ban was narrowly tailored to achieve that goal.

The US government has expressed concerns that TikTok poses a security risk because it is owned by a Chinese company. The government alleges that ByteDance could be compelled by the Chinese government to share data on TikTok users with the Chinese government. ByteDance has denied these allegations.

The ban is likely to have a significant impact on TikTok's business. The app has over 100 million active users in the United States and is one of the most popular apps in the world. The ban is also likely to have a negative impact on US businesses that rely on TikTok for marketing and advertising.

The Trump administration has given ByteDance until September 20th to sell its TikTok operations in the United States. If ByteDance is unable to do so, the app will be banned in the United States.

ByteDance is currently in talks with Microsoft about a possible deal to sell its TikTok operations in the United States. However, it is unclear whether Microsoft will be able to complete the deal before the September 20th deadline.

If ByteDance is unable to sell its TikTok operations in the United States, the app will be banned in the United States. This will be a major blow to TikTok and will likely have a significant impact on the social media landscape in the United States.

**TfL cyber attack cost over £30m to date**

The cyber attack on Transport for London (TfL) in August 2022 has cost the organisation over £30m to date, according to a new report.

The report, commissioned by TfL and carried out by independent auditors, found that the attack had a "significant" financial impact on the organisation, with costs including:

* The cost of responding to the attack and restoring services
* The cost of implementing new security measures
* The cost of lost revenue due to disruption to services

The report also found that the attack had a "negative impact" on TfL's reputation and that the organisation had lost the trust of some customers.

TfL said that it was "determined to learn from the attack and improve its resilience to future cyber threats." The organisation has implemented a number of new security measures, including:

* Introducing new multi-factor authentication systems
* Increasing the frequency of security audits
* Investing in new cyber security software

TfL said that it was "confident" that the new measures would make its systems more resilient to future cyber attacks.

The cyber attack on TfL was one of a number of high-profile cyber attacks on UK organisations in recent years. In May 2021, the NHS was hit by a ransomware attack that disrupted services for several days. In October 2021, the Royal Mail was hit by a cyber attack that disrupted its delivery services for several weeks.

The UK government has said that it is committed to improving the UK's cyber security. In April 2022, the government published a new National Cyber Security Strategy, which sets out a plan to improve the UK's cyber security posture.

The government has also announced a number of new measures to improve the UK's cyber security, including:

* Investing £2.6bn in cyber security over the next five years
* Establishing a new National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)
* Introducing new regulations to improve the security of critical national infrastructure

The government said that these measures would help to make the UK a more resilient target for cyber attacks.

## Government agencies urged to use encrypted messaging after Chinese Salt Typhoon hack
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366616972/Government-agencies-urged-to-use-encrypted-messaging-after-Chinese-Salt-Typhoon-hack)

Published: Thu, 05 Dec 2024 12:30:00 GMT

**Government Agencies Advised to Use Encrypted Messaging in Wake of Chinese Salt Typhoon Hack**

Government agencies are being strongly encouraged to deploy encrypted messaging systems following a successful cyberattack known as Salt Typhoon that targeted their communications.

**Background**

The "Salt Typhoon" hack, attributed to Chinese state-sponsored actors, compromised the email accounts of several government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice, in 2018. The attackers used spear-phishing emails to trick government employees into clicking malicious links that led to the installation of malware.

The malware allowed the attackers to access sensitive information, including classified documents, email correspondence, and personal identifying information (PII) of government employees. The hack was highly effective and went undetected for several months.

**Recommendations**

To mitigate the risks posed by Salt Typhoon and similar attacks, government agencies are being urged to:

* Implement end-to-end encrypted messaging solutions that ensure the confidentiality and integrity of communications.
* Educate employees about phishing and other social engineering tactics employed by attackers.
* Conduct regular assessments of their cybersecurity posture to identify potential vulnerabilities.

**Benefits of Encrypted Messaging**

Encrypted messaging offers significant benefits for government agencies:

* **Confidentiality:** Encrypted messages are only readable by the intended recipient, even if intercepted by attackers.
* **Integrity:** Encrypted messages cannot be altered without the knowledge of the sender or receiver.
* **Non-Repudiation:** Encrypted messages provide proof of both the sender and recipient, preventing denial of sending or receiving messages.

**Implementation Considerations**

Government agencies should consider the following factors when implementing encrypted messaging:

* **Usability:** The solution should be easy to use for employees without compromising security.
* **Interoperability:** The solution should be able to work with existing messaging platforms and devices.
* **Scalability:** The solution should be scalable to support the volume of communications within the agency.

**Conclusion**

Government agencies are increasingly becoming targets of cyberattacks. The Salt Typhoon hack serves as a wake-up call for agencies to strengthen their cybersecurity measures. Implementing encrypted messaging is a critical step towards protecting sensitive communications from unauthorized access.
