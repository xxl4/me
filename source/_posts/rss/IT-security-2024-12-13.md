**Russia's Cyber Focus on Ukraine Amid Rising Western Tensions**

Despite escalating tensions between Russia and the West, Russia has primarily directed its cyber attacks on Ukraine rather than Western targets. This strategic shift underscores Russia's prioritization of maintaining control over Ukraine and countering Ukrainian resistance to its military operations.

**Cyber Attacks on Ukraine**

Since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has launched numerous cyber attacks against Ukrainian targets. These attacks have targeted critical infrastructure, government agencies, military networks, and civilian organizations.

The goal of these attacks has been to disrupt Ukrainian operations, gather intelligence, and spread propaganda. In particular, Russia has targeted energy grids, transportation systems, and government websites.

**Reasons for Targeting Ukraine**

Russia's focus on cyber attacks against Ukraine stems from several reasons:

* **Control and Influence:** Cyber attacks enable Russia to disrupt Ukrainian infrastructure, weaken its government, and sow chaos. This helps Russia maintain control and influence over Ukrainian territory.
* **Counterterrorism:** Russia claims that some of its cyber attacks on Ukraine are aimed at countering Ukrainian cyber units that it alleges are engaging in cyberterrorism.

## What is a stream cipher?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/stream-cipher)

Published: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

A stream cipher is a type of symmetric-key cipher that operates on a continuous stream of data, one bit at a time. This is in contrast to block ciphers, which operate on blocks of data of a fixed size. Stream ciphers are often used for encrypting large amounts of data, such as audio and video streams.

Stream ciphers are typically much faster than block ciphers, as they do not need to buffer the entire block of data before encrypting it. However, they are also less secure than block ciphers, as the same keystream is used to encrypt every bit of data. This means that if an attacker is able to obtain the keystream, they will be able to decrypt the entire message.

There are a number of different stream cipher algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular stream cipher algorithms include:

* RC4
* AES-CTR
* ChaCha20
* Salsa20

Stream ciphers are a valuable tool for encrypting large amounts of data. However, it is important to understand the security limitations of stream ciphers before using them for sensitive data.

## What is a block cipher?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/block-cipher)

Published: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

A block cipher is a type of symmetric encryption algorithm that operates on fixed-size blocks of data. Each block is encrypted using the same key, and the resulting ciphertext is a fixed-size block of data. Block ciphers are used in a wide variety of applications, including data encryption, authentication, and key exchange.

The basic operation of a block cipher is as follows:

1. The plaintext is divided into blocks of fixed size.
2. Each block is encrypted using the same key.
3. The resulting ciphertext is a block of data of the same size as the plaintext block.

The security of a block cipher depends on the key size and the algorithm used. Block ciphers with larger key sizes are more difficult to break, and block ciphers with more complex algorithms are also more difficult to break.

Some of the most well-known block ciphers include AES, DES, and Triple DES. AES is the most widely used block cipher today, and it is considered to be very secure. DES is an older block cipher that is still used in some applications, but it is less secure than AES. Triple DES is a variation of DES that is more secure than DES, but it is also slower.

## What is cipher block chaining (CBC)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/cipher-block-chaining)

Published: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) is a block cipher mode of operation that uses a chaining mechanism to encrypt and decrypt data. In CBC, the output of each block cipher operation is XORed with the previous plaintext block before being encrypted. This results in a ciphertext that is dependent on all of the previous plaintext blocks, making it more difficult to break than if the blocks were encrypted independently.

CBC is a commonly used mode of operation for block ciphers, and it is often used in conjunction with a padding scheme to ensure that the data is of a size that is evenly divisible by the block size of the cipher.

Here is a diagram that illustrates how CBC works:

[Diagram of CBC mode of operation]

The diagram shows the following steps:

1. The plaintext is divided into blocks of size equal to the block size of the cipher.
2. An initialization vector (IV) is randomly generated.
3. The first plaintext block is XORed with the IV and then encrypted.
4. The output of the encryption operation is XORed with the next plaintext block and then encrypted.
5. This process is repeated until all of the plaintext blocks have been encrypted.
6. The ciphertext consists of the concatenation of all of the encrypted blocks.

To decrypt the ciphertext, the following steps are performed in reverse order:

1. The ciphertext is divided into blocks of size equal to the block size of the cipher.
2. The first ciphertext block is decrypted and then XORed with the IV.
3. The output of the decryption operation is XORed with the next ciphertext block and then decrypted.
4. This process is repeated until all of the ciphertext blocks have been decrypted.
5. The plaintext consists of the concatenation of all of the decrypted blocks.

CBC is a secure mode of operation that is well-suited for encrypting large amounts of data. However, it is important to note that CBC is not secure against certain types of attacks, such as padding oracle attacks.

## What is user authentication?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/user-authentication)

Published: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT

User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. This is typically done by requiring the user to provide some form of identification, such as a username and password. Once the user's identity has been verified, they are granted access to the system or resource they are attempting to access.

User authentication is an important security measure that helps to protect systems and resources from unauthorized access. By requiring users to provide some form of identification, it is possible to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to sensitive information or resources.

There are a number of different methods that can be used for user authentication. Some of the most common methods include:

* **Username and password:** This is the most common method of user authentication. Users are required to provide a username and password in order to access the system or resource.
* **Biometrics:** Biometrics are physical or behavioral characteristics that can be used to identify a person. Some common biometric authentication methods include fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, and voice recognition.
* **Smart cards:** Smart cards are physical cards that contain a microprocessor and memory chip. Smart cards can be used to store user authentication credentials, such as a username and password, or a biometric template.
* **Tokens:** Tokens are physical devices that generate a one-time password or other authentication credential. Tokens can be used to provide an additional layer of security to user authentication.

The method of user authentication that is used will depend on the level of security that is required. For systems and resources that require a high level of security, it is recommended to use a combination of different authentication methods.

**TfL Cyber Attack Costs Rise to Â£30m**

Transport for London (TfL) has revealed that the cyber attack it suffered in August 2022 has now cost the organization over Â£30 million. This includes the cost of incident response, recovery, and ongoing security measures.

The attack, which was later attributed to a criminal gang in Russia, targeted TfL's operational systems and caused significant disruption to its services. Tube and bus networks were affected, and TfL was forced to introduce new security measures to protect its systems.

In the aftermath of the attack, TfL launched a major investigation into what happened and has since implemented a number of new security measures. These include:

* Enhanced monitoring and detection systems
* Improved encryption and authentication protocols
* Increased staff training and awareness programs

TfL has also been working closely with law enforcement agencies to investigate the attack and bring those responsible to justice.

The cyber attack on TfL is a reminder of the growing threat of cybercrime and the need for organizations to take appropriate steps to protect their systems. TfL's response to the attack has been praised by security experts, who say it demonstrates best practices in incident response and recovery.

However, the cost of the attack is a serious concern, and it is likely to have a significant impact on TfL's budget. The organization has said that it is still assessing the full financial impact of the attack, but it is clear that it will be substantial.

The cyber attack on TfL is a wake-up call for all organizations, regardless of size or sector. It is essential to have a robust cybersecurity strategy in place to protect against the growing threat of cybercrime.

**Common Criteria (CC) for Information Technology Security Evaluation**

The Common Criteria (CC) is an international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) that provides a common framework for evaluating the security of information technology (IT) products and systems.

**Objectives of CC:**

* Establish a common set of requirements for evaluating IT security
* Ensure that evaluations are consistent and objective
* Facilitate international recognition of evaluations

**Scope of CC:**

* Covers all aspects of IT security, including:
    * Confidentiality
    * Integrity
    * Availability
    * Accountability
    * Privacy

**Evaluation Process:**

* **Target of Evaluation (TOE):** The IT product or system being evaluated
* **Protection Profile (PP):** A set of security requirements that the TOE must meet
* **Evaluation Report:** A document that documents the evaluation process and results

**Evaluation Levels (EALs):**

CC defines seven Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs) that range from basic to high assurance. EAL 7 is the most rigorous level of evaluation.

**Benefits of CC:**

* **Increased Confidence:** Provides assurance that evaluated products meet stated security requirements
* **International Recognition:** Evaluations are recognized by over 30 countries
* **Reduced Risk:** Helps organizations identify and mitigate potential security risks
* **Cost Savings:** Can reduce the cost of evaluating IT products and systems

**Common Criteria Evaluation Process:**

1. **Define Evaluation Scope:** Identify the TOE and applicable PP.
2. **Conduct Evaluation:** Use specified evaluation methods to assess the TOE against the PP.
3. **Prepare Evaluation Report:** Document the evaluation process and results.
4. **Certification:** Review and approve the evaluation report.
5. **Publication:** Publish the evaluation results and award a certificate if the TOE meets the specified requirements.

**Key Concepts in CC:**

* **Security Target (ST):** A document that describes the security objectives and functional specifications of the TOE.
* **Security Policy (SP):** A logical description of the security measures implemented in the TOE.
* **Assurance Requirements:** Specific security controls and measures that the TOE must meet.
* **Objectives:** High-level goals that the evaluation will assess.
* **Metrics:** Measurable characteristics of the TOE that are evaluated.

**Government Agencies Urged to Use Encrypted Messaging After Chinese Salt Typhoon Hack**

Following the recent Chinese Salt Typhoon hack, government agencies have been strongly urged to implement encrypted messaging systems to protect sensitive data and communications.

**The Salt Typhoon Hack**

The Salt Typhoon hack, discovered in July 2022, targeted U.S. government agencies and academia with malicious phishing emails that exploited the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability. The attackers were able to access sensitive information, including emails, documents, and passwords.

**The Need for Encrypted Messaging**

Encrypted messaging ensures that messages are transmitted in an encrypted form, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized individuals to intercept and read them. By encrypting messages, government agencies can protect sensitive information from being compromised in the event of a hack or data breach.

**Government Recommendations**

In a recent memo, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) strongly encouraged all government agencies to adopt encrypted messaging solutions. CISA recommended the use of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) protocols, which provide the highest level of security by encrypting messages at both the sending and receiving end.

**Benefits of Encrypted Messaging**

Enhancing the security of government communications offers numerous benefits, including:

* **Protection of sensitive information:** Encrypted messaging prevents unauthorized access to emails, documents, and other sensitive data.
* **Compliance with regulations:** Many government agencies are required to comply with regulations that mandate the encryption of sensitive data.
* **Trust and confidence:** Encrypted messaging builds trust between government agencies and their stakeholders by ensuring the confidentiality of communications.
* **Reduced risk of espionage:** Encryption makes it more difficult for foreign intelligence services to spy on government communications.

**Conclusion**

In the wake of the Salt Typhoon hack, government agencies have been advised to implement encrypted messaging systems as a crucial measure to protect sensitive data and communications. By adopting E2EE protocols, agencies can enhance their cybersecurity posture and safeguard the integrity of government communications.
