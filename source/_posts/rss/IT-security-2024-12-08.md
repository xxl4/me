**Second Merseyside hospital hit by cyber attack**

A second hospital in Merseyside has been hit by a cyber attack, forcing it to cancel some operations and appointments.

Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust said it was targeted on Saturday, and that its IT systems had been "significantly affected".

The trust said it was working with the National Cyber Security Centre to resolve the issue, but that some services were likely to be disrupted for "some time".

A number of operations and appointments have been cancelled, and patients are being advised to contact the hospital to check if their appointment is still going ahead.

The trust said it was "extremely sorry" for the disruption, and that it was doing everything it could to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

A spokesperson for the trust said: "We would like to reassure our patients that we are doing everything we can to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We are working closely with the National Cyber Security Centre and other agencies to investigate the attack and restore our systems.

"We are extremely sorry for the disruption this is causing, and we would like to thank our patients for their understanding."

The attack on Southport and Ormskirk Hospital is the second to hit a Merseyside hospital in recent weeks. In October, Aintree University Hospital was hit by a ransomware attack, which forced it to cancel all non-urgent operations and appointments.

The attacks are a reminder of the growing threat posed by cyber attacks to the NHS. In recent years, a number of NHS trusts have been hit by ransomware attacks, which have disrupted patient care and cost the NHS millions of pounds.

The NHS is working to improve its cyber security, but it is a complex and challenging task. The NHS is a large and diverse organisation, with a wide range of IT systems. This makes it difficult to protect against all potential cyber threats.

The NHS is also working to raise awareness of the cyber security risks facing patients and staff. Patients are being advised to be careful about what information they share online, and to be aware of the risks of phishing emails and other cyber scams.

Staff are also being trained on how to protect themselves and the NHS from cyber attacks. The NHS is also working to improve its incident response capabilities, so that it can respond quickly and effectively to any cyber attacks that do occur.

## What is obfuscation and how does it work?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/obfuscation)

Published: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:27:00 GMT

**Obfuscation**

Obfuscation is the process of altering code, data, or information to make it difficult for others to understand or reverse engineer. The goal of obfuscation is to protect intellectual property and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**How Obfuscation Works**

Obfuscation can be done using a variety of techniques, including:

* **Renaming:** Changing variable, function, and class names to make them less meaningful or guessable.
* **Control flow flattening:** Removing or altering loops and conditional statements to make the code harder to follow.
* **Dead code insertion:** Adding code that does not affect the program's functionality but makes it more difficult to analyze.
* **Constant folding:** Replacing expressions with constants to make the code less readable.
* **Encryption:** Encrypting data or code to prevent unauthorized access.

**Types of Obfuscation**

There are two main types of obfuscation:

* **Static obfuscation:** Applied to code or data at compile time, resulting in a modified binary file or source code.
* **Dynamic obfuscation:** Applied at runtime, typically using a runtime transformer or virtual machine to dynamically modify the code in memory.

**Benefits of Obfuscation**

Obfuscation provides several benefits, including:

* **Protection of intellectual property:** Hinders competitors from stealing proprietary code or algorithms.
* **Prevention of unauthorized access:** Makes it harder for attackers to exploit software vulnerabilities or access sensitive data.
* **Improved performance:** Obfuscated code can be faster than un-obfuscated code in some cases, due to the removal of unused code and optimizations.

**Limitations of Obfuscation**

While obfuscation can be effective, it has some limitations:

* **Increased code size:** Obfuscated code can be larger than un-obfuscated code due to the addition of extra code.
* **Reduced debuggability:** Obfuscated code can be harder to debug, which can increase development time.
* **Potential performance issues:** Poorly implemented obfuscation can introduce performance bottlenecks.
