**Ransomware Takedowns Didn't Deter Cybercriminals**

**Main Idea:** Despite law enforcement efforts to disrupt ransomware operations, cybercriminals have adapted and continue to pose a significant threat.

**Key Points:**

* Law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and Europol, have taken down several major ransomware groups in recent years.
* These takedowns have disrupted operations and led to arrests.
* However, cybercriminals have proven resilient and have adapted to these measures.
* Ransomware operators have shifted to using new tactics, such as double extortion and targeting managed service providers.
* The number of ransomware variants has increased, making it more difficult for security companies to keep up.
* Despite ongoing efforts to dismantle ransomware groups, the threat continues to evolve and remains a major concern for businesses.

**Implications:**

* Businesses should remain vigilant and invest in comprehensive cybersecurity measures.
* Law enforcement and security companies need to continue collaborating to combat ransomware.
* Governments must prioritize disrupting ransomware operations and prosecuting cybercriminals.
* Individuals should educate themselves about ransomware and take steps to protect their devices and data.

**Additional Information:**

* In 2021, the FBI reported a 64% increase in ransomware attacks compared to the previous year.
* The average ransom payment increased by 82% to over $200,000.
* Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting critical infrastructure and sensitive organizations, such as healthcare systems and government agencies.

Sure, here is what I found about UK’s cyber incident reporting law:

In May 2022, the UK government announced plans to introduce new legislation requiring businesses to report cyberattacks. This announcement followed a consultation on proposals for mandatory cyber incident reporting, which closed in February 2022. The government has stated that the new law is necessary to improve the UK's ability to detect, respond to, and prevent cyberattacks.

The proposed law would require businesses to report certain types of cyberattacks to the government within 72 hours of becoming aware of them. The government has said that it will provide guidance on what types of attacks must be reported, but it is likely that this will include major attacks that have a significant impact on the business or its customers.

The government has stated that the new law will be introduced in 2025. It is currently unclear what penalties businesses will face if they fail to report cyberattacks, but it is likely that they will be significant.

The proposed law has been welcomed by some businesses, who argue that it will help to improve the UK's cybersecurity posture. However, other businesses have expressed concerns about the cost and complexity of compliance with the new law.

It is important to note that the proposed law is still in its early stages of development and may change before it is introduced in 2025. However, it is clear that the UK government is committed to improving the UK's cybersecurity and that mandatory cyber incident reporting is likely to be a key part of this strategy.

**Additional information**

The UK government has stated that the new law will be based on the NIS Directive, which is an EU directive that requires member states to implement measures to improve the security of network and information systems. The NIS Directive was transposed into UK law in 2018, but the UK government has stated that the new law will go further than the NIS Directive by requiring businesses to report cyberattacks.

The UK government has also stated that the new law will be part of a wider package of measures to improve the UK's cybersecurity. These measures will include increased investment in cybersecurity research and development, and the creation of a new National Cyber Security Centre.

**Conclusion**

The UK government's plans to introduce mandatory cyber incident reporting are a significant development in the UK's cybersecurity strategy. The new law will require businesses to report certain types of cyberattacks to the government within 72 hours of becoming aware of them. The government has stated that the new law will be introduced in 2025.

**NCSC celebrates eight years as Horne blows in**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is celebrating its eighth anniversary today, as Ciaran Martin steps down as its chief executive.

The NCSC was launched in October 2016 as a public-private partnership between the UK government and the cyber security industry. Its mission is to make the UK the safest place to live and do business online.

In its eight years, the NCSC has made significant progress in its mission. It has helped to prevent and respond to a number of major cyber attacks, including the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks. It has also worked with businesses and individuals to improve their cyber security practices.

As a result of the NCSC's work, the UK is now widely recognised as a global leader in cyber security. The NCSC has been praised for its technical expertise, its innovative approach to cyber security, and its strong relationships with the private sector.

Ciaran Martin, who has led the NCSC since its inception, is stepping down today. He will be replaced by Lindy Cameron, who has been the NCSC's deputy director for operations since 2017.

Martin said that he was "incredibly proud" of what the NCSC had achieved in its eight years. He said that the NCSC had "made a real difference to the security of the UK" and that he was "confident that it will continue to do so under Lindy's leadership."

Cameron said that she was "honoured" to be appointed as the NCSC's new chief executive. She said that she was "looking forward to working with the NCSC's talented team to build on the progress that has been made in recent years."

The NCSC's eighth anniversary comes at a time when the threats to the UK's cyber security are growing. The NCSC is committed to continuing to work with the government, the private sector, and individuals to protect the UK from these threats.
