## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE) is a technology that allows a driver to lock and unlock their vehicle without taking their key fob out of their pocket or purse. The system uses a radio frequency identification (RFID) chip in the key fob to communicate with the vehicle's electronic control unit (ECU). When the driver approaches the vehicle, the ECU uses a low-frequency signal to detect the presence of the key fob. If the key fob is present, the ECU will send a high-frequency signal to unlock the doors. The driver can then start the vehicle by pressing the start button on the dashboard.

PKE systems are becoming increasingly common in new vehicles. They offer a number of advantages over traditional key-based systems, including:

* Convenience: Drivers never have to fumble for their keys, which can be especially helpful in bad weather or when carrying packages.
* Security: PKE systems are more difficult to bypass than traditional key-based systems. The key fob is constantly sending a signal to the ECU, which makes it difficult for thieves to clone or hack the signal.
* Comfort: PKE systems allow drivers to keep their keys in their pockets or purses, which can be more comfortable than carrying them around in their hands.
