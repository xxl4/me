**CrowdStrike Incident Highlights Need for Rethinking Cybersecurity**

The recent CrowdStrike incident serves as a wake-up call that underscores the urgent need to rethink and enhance cybersecurity strategies.

**Sophisticated Attacks Require Robust Defenses**

The attackers breached CrowdStrike's network through a highly sophisticated phishing attack. This incident demonstrates that even well-established cybersecurity companies are not immune to advanced threats. Organizations must invest in robust defenses that can detect and mitigate such attacks.

**Insider Threats and Least Privilege**

Investigators believe the attackers gained elevated privileges within CrowdStrike's network. This highlights the importance of implementing strong least-privilege principles and monitoring employee access to sensitive data. Organizations should consider separating duties and using multi-factor authentication to minimize the risks associated with insider threats.

**Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**

The CrowdStrike breach reportedly involved a vulnerability in a third-party vendor. Supply chain vulnerabilities have become increasingly common, making it essential for organizations to assess the security of their vendors. Regular security audits and incident response plans are crucial to mitigate these risks.

**Importance of Response and Recovery Plans**

CrowdStrike's quick and effective response to the incident prevented further damage. Organizations should develop comprehensive incident response plans that outline clear roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols. Recovery plans should also be in place to minimize business disruption and restore operations as quickly as possible.

**Collaboration and Information Sharing**

Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. The CrowdStrike incident emphasizes the importance of collaboration and information sharing among organizations. By sharing threat intelligence and best practices, companies can collectively enhance their defenses and stay ahead of attackers.

**Investment in Research and Development**

Continuous research and development are critical for addressing evolving cyber threats. Organizations should invest in developing new technologies and solutions to stay ahead of the curve. Government and industry partnerships can also accelerate innovation and drive cybersecurity advancements.

**Conclusion**

The CrowdStrike incident is a stark reminder that cybersecurity is an ongoing battle. By rethinking our strategies, investing in robust defenses, and fostering collaboration, organizations can enhance their resilience and protect their critical assets from cyber threats. The time for complacency has passed. It is time to prioritize cybersecurity and safeguard our digital future.

## What is email spam and how to fight it?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/spam)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**What is Email Spam?**

Spam refers to unsolicited, unwanted, or promotional emails that are sent in bulk. It often includes fraudulent or harmful content. Spam can take various forms, such as:

* Commercial advertisements
* Phishing scams
* Malware attacks
* Fake news or misinformation

**How to Fight Spam:**

**1. Use Spam Filters:**

- Most email providers have built-in spam filters that block or redirect spam to a spam folder.
- Configure your spam filter to be aggressive. However, be aware that legitimate emails may occasionally be caught in the spam filter.

**2. Mark Emails as Spam:**

- When you receive a spam email, report it as spam to your email provider. This helps train the spam filter and prevent similar emails from reaching your inbox.

**3. Be Cautious of Suspicious Links:**

- Avoid clicking on links in emails from unknown senders or emails that sound suspicious. Hover over links to check the actual destination before clicking.

**4. Use Anti-Spam Software:**

- Install anti-spam software on your computer or mobile device. This software can scan incoming emails for spam and block them.

**5. Create Strong Passwords:**

- Weak passwords can make your email account vulnerable to spam attacks. Use strong, complex passwords and change them regularly.

**6. Be Aware of Phishing Scams:**

- Phishing emails are designed to trick you into giving up personal information or financial details. Be cautious of emails that request this information or claim to be from a legitimate organization.

**7. Use Disposable Email Addresses:**

- For online sign-ups or accounts that you may not use regularly, consider using a disposable email address. This helps prevent your actual email address from being targeted by spammers.

**8. Opt Out of Marketing Emails:**

- When signing up for services or making purchases online, uncheck any boxes that allow marketers to send you promotional emails.

**9. Report Spam to Authorities:**

- If you receive spam that is particularly malicious or fraudulent, report it to the appropriate authorities, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE), also known as Proximity Keyless Entry, is a keyless entry system that allows a vehicle to be unlocked and started without the use of a traditional key. Instead, it uses a small, battery-powered key fob or card that emits a radio signal. When the key fob or card is brought close to the vehicle, the radio signal is detected and the vehicle's doors are unlocked. Once inside the vehicle, the driver can start the engine by pressing a button.

PKE systems are becoming increasingly common on new vehicles, as they offer a number of advantages over traditional keys. These advantages include:

* Convenience: PKE systems are much more convenient than traditional keys, as they eliminate the need to fumble for keys or insert a key into a lock.
* Security: PKE systems are also more secure than traditional keys, as they are less likely to be lost or stolen. Additionally, PKE systems often include features such as rolling codes, which make it difficult for thieves to duplicate the signal.
* Comfort: PKE systems can also be more comfortable to use, as they allow drivers to unlock and start their vehicles without having to remove their keys or key fobs from their pockets or bags.

PKE systems are a convenient, secure, and comfortable way to access and start a vehicle. They are becoming increasingly common on new vehicles, and are likely to become even more popular in the future.
