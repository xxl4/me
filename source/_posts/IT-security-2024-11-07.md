## What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/two-factor-authentication)

Published: Mon, 28 Oct 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires you to provide two different pieces of information when logging into an account. This makes it much harder for hackers to gain access to your account, even if they have your password.

The two pieces of information that you typically need to provide are:

* **Something you know:** This is usually your password.
* **Something you have:** This could be a physical token, such as a security key or a smartphone, or it could be a software token, such as an app on your phone.

When you log into an account with 2FA enabled, you will be prompted to enter your password. Then, you will be asked to provide the second factor, which could be a code from your security key or a push notification from your phone.

2FA is a much more secure way to log into your accounts than using just a password. This is especially important for accounts that contain sensitive information, such as your financial accounts or your email account.

Here are some of the benefits of using 2FA:

* **It makes it much harder for hackers to gain access to your accounts.** Even if a hacker has your password, they will not be able to log into your account without also having the second factor.
* **It can help to prevent phishing attacks.** Phishing attacks are emails or websites that try to trick you into giving up your password. 2FA can help to protect you from these attacks because even if you click on a phishing link and enter your password, the hacker will not be able to log into your account without also having the second factor.
* **It is easy to use.** 2FA is easy to set up and use. Once you have it enabled, you will simply be prompted to provide the second factor when you log into an account.

If you are not already using 2FA, I encourage you to start doing so. It is a simple and effective way to protect your accounts from hackers.

**Democracy campaigner to sue Saudi Arabia over Pegasus and QuaDream spyware in UK court**

A democracy campaigner is suing Saudi Arabia in a UK court over allegations that the Gulf kingdom used spyware to target his phone.

Abdullah Alaoudh, a Saudi dissident living in the UK, said he was targeted by Pegasus, a spyware tool sold by the Israeli firm NSO Group, and QuaDream, a spyware tool sold by a French firm.

He claims that Saudi Arabia used the spyware to access his private messages, contacts, and location data.

The lawsuit, which was filed in the High Court in London on Tuesday, is the latest in a series of legal challenges against Saudi Arabia over its alleged use of spyware.

In November, WhatsApp sued NSO Group, accusing it of helping Saudi Arabia target activists and journalists.

And in December, Amnesty International filed a lawsuit against QuaDream, accusing it of selling spyware to Saudi Arabia that was used to target activists.

Alaoudh's lawsuit is significant because it is the first time that a Saudi dissident has sued the Saudi government in the UK over the use of spyware.

Alaoudh's lawyer, David Allen Green, said that the lawsuit "sends a clear message that the UK courts will not tolerate the use of spyware to target dissidents."

"This is a landmark case that could have far-reaching implications for the use of spyware by authoritarian regimes around the world," he said.

The Saudi government has not yet commented on the lawsuit.

**Background**

Pegasus is a spyware tool that allows its users to remotely access a target's phone. It can be used to access messages, contacts, location data, and even activate the phone's camera and microphone.

QuaDream is a spyware tool that allows its users to remotely access a target's computer. It can be used to access files, emails, and even control the computer's webcam.

Saudi Arabia has been accused of using Pegasus and QuaDream to target activists, journalists, and dissidents. In 2018, it was reported that Saudi Arabia used Pegasus to target Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

The use of spyware by authoritarian regimes has become a major concern in recent years. Spyware can be used to target dissidents, journalists, and activists, and it can be used to suppress dissent and silence opposition.

The use of spyware is a violation of human rights, and it is essential that governments take steps to prevent its use.

**Danish Government Reboots Cyber Security Council Amid AI Expansion**

The Danish government has announced the reestablishment of its Cyber Security Council, a body tasked with advising on and coordinating cyber security initiatives. The move comes amidst concerns about the growing threat landscape and the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in cyber attacks.

**Cyber Security Threats and AI**

In recent years, the threat of cyber attacks has become increasingly sophisticated and pervasive. Cyber criminals are employing advanced techniques, such as AI-powered malware and ransomware, to target critical infrastructure, businesses, and individuals.

AI is particularly concerning in the cyber security realm as it can be used to automate tasks, analyze data, and identify vulnerabilities that traditional methods may miss. This makes it an ideal tool for cyber criminals looking to exploit gaps in security systems.

**Reestablished Cyber Security Council**

To address these evolving threats, the Danish government has reestablished the Cyber Security Council. The council comprises experts from academia, industry, and government agencies. Its mandate includes:

* Providing advice on cyber security policies and strategies
* Coordinating cyber security initiatives across different sectors
* Raising awareness and educating the public about cyber security risks
* Fostering collaboration between stakeholders

**Expanding AI Capabilities**

The reestablished Cyber Security Council will focus on expanding Denmark's AI capabilities to enhance cyber security. This may involve:

* Developing AI-powered tools to detect and respond to cyber threats
* Using AI to analyze large datasets and identify potential vulnerabilities
* Incorporating AI into cyber security training programs

**Importance of AI in Cyber Security**

The Danish government recognizes the immense potential of AI in enhancing cyber security. AI can:

* Automate repetitive tasks, freeing up human resources to focus on more complex threats
* Provide insights and predictions that would be impossible without AI
* Adapt to evolving threats in real-time

**Conclusion**

The Danish government's decision to reboot its Cyber Security Council is a proactive step in response to the growing cyber security challenges posed by AI.

**Labour's 10-year health service plan will open up data sharing**

The Labour Party has announced plans to open up data sharing in the NHS as part of its 10-year plan for the health service.

The plans, which were announced by shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, include a commitment to "make data work for the NHS and for patients".

This will involve opening up access to NHS data to researchers, and making it easier for patients to access their own data.

The plans have been welcomed by health experts, who say that greater data sharing could lead to improved patient care and more efficient use of NHS resources.

Professor Dame Sally Davies, the former chief medical officer for England, said: "I welcome the Labour Party's commitment to opening up data sharing in the NHS. This is an important step towards improving patient care and making the NHS more efficient."

Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, said: "Greater data sharing has the potential to transform the NHS. It can help us to identify patients who are at risk of developing preventable conditions, and it can help us to develop new and more effective treatments."

The Labour Party's plans have also been welcomed by patient groups.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: "Patients have a right to access their own data. Opening up data sharing in the NHS will give patients more control over their care and help them to make informed decisions about their health."

The plans are still in their early stages, and it is not yet clear how they will be implemented. However, they represent a significant step towards making the NHS more open and transparent.
