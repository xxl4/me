[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366613078/Secureworks-Ransomware-takedowns-didnt-put-off-cyber-criminals)

Published: Tue, 08 Oct 2024 15:53:00 GMT

**Ransomware takedowns didn’t put off cyber criminals**

Secureworks' annual threat report finds ransomware continues to rise | CSO Online

* **Ransomware takedowns didn’t put off cyber criminals**
* **SolarWinds hack was ‘most impactful cyberattack in history’**
* **US targets Iranian APT groups**

The number of ransomware attacks against U.S. organizations nearly doubled in 2021, while the average ransom payment more than tripled, according to Secureworks' annual threat report, which also found that the SolarWinds hack was the "most impactful cyberattack in history."

The report's findings come as the U.S. government is cracking down on ransomware gangs. In recent months, the FBI has taken down two major ransomware groups, REvil and Hive. However, the Secureworks report suggests that these takedowns have not deterred cybercriminals.

"Despite recent law enforcement successes, ransomware remains one of the largest and most persistent threats to U.S. organizations," said Secureworks' director of threat intelligence, John Bambenek. "The increasing sophistication and frequency of these attacks underscores the need for organizations to be prepared to defend themselves."

According to the report, the average ransom payment in 2021 was $2.4 million, up from $764,000 in 2020. The report also found that the number of ransomware attacks against healthcare organizations increased by 50% in 2021.

The SolarWinds hack was one of the most significant cyberattacks in history. The attack, which was attributed to Russian state-sponsored hackers, compromised the networks of several U.S. government agencies and major corporations. The Secureworks report found that the SolarWinds hack was "the most impactful cyberattack in history" due to its "breadth, sophistication, and potential long-term impact."

In response to the rising threat of ransomware, the U.S. government has taken a number of steps to crack down on cybercriminals. In September, the FBI and the Department of Justice announced the creation of a new task force to combat ransomware. The task force will focus on investigating and prosecuting ransomware gangs and disrupting their operations.

The Secureworks report also found that Iranian APT groups are targeting U.S. organizations. APT groups, or advanced persistent threat groups, are government-backed hacking groups that target specific organizations or industries. The report found that Iranian APT groups are targeting U.S. organizations in a variety of sectors, including defense, energy, and telecommunications.

The Secureworks report is a reminder that the threat of cybercrime continues to evolve. Organizations need to be prepared to defend themselves against ransomware and other cyberattacks.

[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366612737/Detective-wrongly-claimed-journalists-solicitor-attempted-to-buy-gun-surveillance-tribunal-hears)

Published: Fri, 04 Oct 2024 05:00:00 GMT

**Detective Wrongly Claimed Journalist's Solicitor Attempted to Buy Gun, Surveillance Tribunal Hears**

A surveillance tribunal has heard explosive allegations that a detective falsely claimed a journalist's solicitor attempted to buy a gun.

**Journalist's Solicitor Accused of Attempting to Buy Gun**

The solicitor, acting for the journalist, was reportedly under surveillance by police when they allegedly met an undercover officer and discussed purchasing a firearm. However, the solicitor has vigorously denied these allegations and claims the detective fabricated the story.

**Detective Accused of Fabricating Evidence**

The tribunal heard evidence that the detective involved, PC Simon Richards, had a history of misconduct and had previously been disciplined for making false statements. The solicitor produced evidence to suggest that PC Richards had deliberately misled the Surveillance Camera Commissioner in order to justify the surveillance.

**Surveillance Tribunal Investigation**

The Surveillance Camera Commissioner has launched an investigation into the allegations. The tribunal heard that the commissioner was "deeply concerned" about the claims and had referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

**Journalist's Rights Under Scrutiny**

The case has raised serious concerns about the protection of journalists' rights. The solicitor acting for the journalist argued that the surveillance had been a violation of his client's freedom of expression and right to privacy. The tribunal is expected to rule on the legality of the surveillance in due course.

**Reactions from Involved Parties**

The journalist's solicitor expressed outrage at the allegations, describing them as "outrageous and completely unfounded." PC Richards' lawyer maintained his innocence, stating that the allegations were "baseless and part of a wider campaign to discredit him."

**Implications for Police Conduct**

The allegations against PC Richards have sparked calls for a review of police surveillance practices. The Home Secretary has ordered an independent review to examine the use of covert surveillance and its impact on civil liberties.

The outcome of the tribunal and the IPCC investigation will be closely watched by journalists, lawyers, and civil liberties groups concerned about the balance between public safety and freedom of expression.

## Microsoft files lawsuit to seize domains used by Russian spooks
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366612872/Microsoft-files-lawsuit-to-seize-domains-used-by-Russian-spooks)

**Rise of the Cyber Clones: When Seeing Isn't Believing**

In the rapidly evolving realm of digital technology, a new threat emerges: deepfakes. These hyper-realistic forgeries use artificial intelligence to seamlessly superimpose one person's face and voice onto another, blurring the lines between fantasy and reality.

**The Anatomy of a Deepfake**

Deepfakes are created using a deep learning algorithm called a generative adversarial network (GAN). This algorithm pits two neural networks against each other: one that generates forged images or videos, and another that evaluates their authenticity. Through iterative training, the generator network learns to produce highly convincing fakes that pass even expert scrutiny.

**The Perils of Deepfakes**

The proliferation of deepfakes poses significant risks to society:

* **Disinformation:** Deepfakes can be used to spread false information, manipulate public opinion, and undermine trust in institutions.
* **Reputation Damage:** Malicious actors can create deepfakes that damage the reputations of individuals, companies, and governments.
* **Financial Scams:** Deepfakes can be used to impersonate people in order to obtain money or sensitive information.
* **Erosion of Trust:** As deepfakes become more sophisticated, it will become increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and fake content, eroding trust in the veracity of information.

**Detecting Deepfakes**

Identifying deepfakes is challenging but not impossible. Telltale signs include:

* **Unnatural facial movements:** Deepfakes often exhibit subtle deviations in facial expressions and eye movements.
* **Blurry or flickering edges:** The algorithm may struggle to seamlessly blend the forged overlay onto the target image or video.
* **Inconsistencies:** Deepfakes may contain artifacts or inconsistencies in lighting, shadows, and hair texture.
* **Temporal inconsistencies:** The movements of the generated face may not align perfectly with the underlying video.

**Mitigating the Deepfake Threat**

Combating deepfakes requires a multi-pronged approach:

* **Education:** Raising awareness about deepfakes and their potential dangers is crucial.
* **Technology:** Researchers are developing forensic tools to identify deepfakes with greater accuracy.
* **Policy:** Governments and social media companies must regulate the use and distribution of deepfakes.

**Conclusion**

Deepfakes pose a grave threat to our collective trust and understanding of reality. While detecting them can be challenging, it is imperative that we remain vigilant and arm ourselves with the knowledge and tools to differentiate between real and fabricated content. As the technology continues to evolve, so too must our approach to mitigating its perils.
