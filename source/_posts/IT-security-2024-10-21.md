**NCSC celebrates eight years as Horne blows in**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) celebrated its eighth anniversary on Tuesday with a reception at the Science Museum in London. The event was attended by NCSC staff, industry partners, and government officials, including Minister of State for Security and Borders Damian Hinds.

In his speech, Hinds praised the NCSC for its work in protecting the UK from cyber threats. He said that the NCSC had played a "vital role" in "keeping the UK safe online" and that it was "a world leader in cyber security."

The NCSC was established in 2016 as a joint venture between the government and the private sector. It is responsible for providing advice and support to businesses, individuals, and government departments on cyber security.

The NCSC has been involved in a number of high-profile incidents in recent years, including the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 and the SolarWinds supply chain attack in 2020. The NCSC has also played a key role in the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing advice to businesses and individuals on how to stay safe online during lockdowns.

At the anniversary event, the NCSC also announced the launch of a new initiative called "Project Horne." Project Horne is a collaboration between the NCSC and the University of Oxford that aims to develop new ways to detect and respond to cyber threats.

Project Horne is named after Dr. Robert Horne, a British mathematician who was one of the pioneers of cyber security. Horne developed the first intrusion detection system in the 1980s.

The NCSC said that Project Horne would "build on the UK's world-leading position in cyber security research" and that it would "help to keep the UK safe online for years to come."
