Today I had arrived in Shanghai At 6:30 am. I sleep on the train only 3 hours, Maybe i need a good sleep, because i have to work for a long time. I don't have breakfast, because i don't have time and don't have the mood to eat. I just want to go home and have drive a car to go to the office.

I have a lot of work to do today, and I need to finish it as soon as possible. I have a meeting with my team at 9:00 am, and I need to prepare for it. I have a lot of tasks to compile, and I need to assign them to my team members.
