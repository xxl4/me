[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as keyless entry or proximity entry, is an advanced automotive security and convenience feature that allows a driver to unlock and start a vehicle without using a physical key.

It is a technology that enables a car to detect the presence of an authorized device, typically a key fob or smartphone, and unlock the doors as the user approaches the vehicle. The user does not need to press any buttons or take any other action.

Here are the key components of PKE:

1. **Key Fob or Smartphone:** The key fob or smartphone acts as the authorized device that communicates with the car. It contains a small transmitter that emits a unique radio frequency (RF) signal.

2. **Vehicle Antenna:** The vehicle is equipped with one or more antennas that listen for the RF signal from the key fob or smartphone.

3. **Security Module:** The security module is responsible for authenticating the signal and authorizing the start/stop or unlock/lock sequence. It checks if the signal matches the authorized key fob or smartphone and ensures that the vehicle is in a safe state for entry or starting.

4. **Door Locks or Start Button:** Once the security module authenticates the signal, it sends a command to the door locks, unlocking them, or to the start button, allowing the vehicle to be started.

PKE offers several benefits, including:

1. **Convenience:** PKE eliminates the need to fumble with keys, making it easier to enter and start your vehicle, especially when carrying packages or when your hands are full.

2. **Security:** PKE can enhance vehicle security as the authorized device must be in close proximity to the vehicle to unlock or start it, reducing the risk of theft or unauthorized entry.

3. **Remote Start:** Some PKE systems allow for remote starting of the vehicle, enabling drivers to warm up or cool down their cars from a distance.

4. **Smart Functions:** PKE can be integrated with other smart features, such as automatic trunk opening or personalization of vehicle settings based on the user's presence.

It's important to note that PKE systems still have some limitations, such as the potential for signal interference or the need to replace batteries in the key fobs.

Published: Tue, 10 Sep 2024 09:15:00 GMT

JFrog and GitHub have announced the availability of new open source security integrations between their respective platforms. These integrations will enable developers to automatically scan their open source dependencies for vulnerabilities and take action to remediate them.

The integrations are based on the open source JFrog Xray platform, which provides comprehensive vulnerability scanning and management capabilities. Xray can be integrated with GitHub Actions, GitHub Security Alerts, and GitHub Dependabot.

With these integrations, developers can:

* Automatically scan their GitHub repositories for open source dependencies
* Receive security alerts for vulnerabilities in their dependencies
* Automatically remediate vulnerabilities by updating to newer versions of dependencies

JFrog and GitHub are also working on a new integration that will allow developers to create and manage security policies for their open source dependencies. This integration will be based on the open source JFrog Artifactory platform, which provides a central repository for managing artifacts and dependencies.

These integrations are a significant step forward in the effort to improve the security of open source software. By making it easier for developers to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in their dependencies, JFrog and GitHub are helping to make the open source ecosystem more secure.

Here are some additional details about the integrations:

* The JFrog Xray GitHub Action can be used to scan GitHub repositories for vulnerabilities. The action can be configured to run on a schedule or when code is pushed to a repository.
* The JFrog Xray GitHub Security Alert can be used to receive alerts for vulnerabilities in GitHub repositories. The alert will include information about the vulnerability, the affected dependencies, and the recommended remediation steps.
* The JFrog Xray GitHub Dependabot can be used to automatically remediate vulnerabilities in GitHub repositories. The Dependabot will automatically update dependencies to newer versions that are not vulnerable to the identified vulnerability.

In addition to these integrations, JFrog and GitHub are also working on a new integration that will allow developers to create and manage security policies for their open source dependencies. This integration will be based on the open source JFrog Artifactory platform, which provides a central repository for managing artifacts and dependencies.

These integrations are a significant step forward in the effort to improve the security of open source software. By making it easier for developers to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in their dependencies, JFrog and GitHub are helping to make the open source ecosystem more secure.
