## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE) is a technology that allows a car to be unlocked and started without the need for a physical key. Instead, a small fob or card is used that emits a radio signal that the car's computer can detect. When the fob is in close proximity to the car, the doors will unlock and the engine will start when the start button is pressed.

PKE is a convenient feature that can make it easier to get in and out of your car, especially if you are carrying a lot of bags or groceries. It can also be helpful if you have a child who is constantly losing their keys.

There are a few different types of PKE systems available. Some systems use a fob that must be carried in your pocket or purse, while others use a card that can be kept in your wallet or credit card holder. There are also some systems that use a smartphone app to unlock and start the car.

PKE systems are generally very secure, but there are some potential security risks to be aware of. For example, if your fob is lost or stolen, someone else could potentially use it to unlock and start your car. To reduce this risk, it is important to keep your fob in a safe place and to report it lost or stolen to your car's manufacturer if it is lost or stolen.
