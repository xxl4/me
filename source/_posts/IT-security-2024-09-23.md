## NCSC exposes Chinese company running malicious Mirai botnet
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366611295/NCSC-exposes-Chinese-company-running-malicious-Mirai-botnet)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 13:18:00 GMT

**NCSC Exposes Chinese Company Running Malicious Mirai Botnet**

The United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has identified and exposed a Chinese company, Shanghai Pudong New Area C&T Co. Ltd. (CNC), as the operator behind a malicious botnet known as Mirai.

**Mirai Botnet**

Mirai is a powerful botnet that has been used to launch large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on websites and online services. It infects internet-connected devices such as routers, webcams, and baby monitors by exploiting vulnerabilities in their firmware.

**CNC's Role**

NCSC's investigation revealed that CNC is the primary operator behind the Mirai botnet. The company has been selling and renting access to the botnet as a DDoS-for-hire service. This has allowed criminals and state-sponsored actors to launch DDoS attacks against their targets.

**Impact of Mirai**

Mirai has been used in a number of high-profile DDoS attacks, including the October 2016 attack that disrupted major websites such as Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify. The botnet has also been linked to attacks on critical infrastructure, such as power plants and hospitals.

**NCSC's Response**

In response to its findings, the NCSC took the following actions:

* Exposed CNC's involvement in operating the Mirai botnet publicly.
* Sanctioned CNC under the U.K.'s National Security and Investment Act, restricting its ability to operate in the U.K.
* Co-ordinated with international law enforcement agencies to disrupt CNC's operations.

**Significance**

The NCSC's actions highlight the increasing role of private companies in the global cyber threat landscape. It also demonstrates the willingness of Western governments to take action against malicious actors operating in foreign jurisdictions.

The exposure of CNC as the operator of the Mirai botnet sends a clear message that cybercrime will not be tolerated and that those responsible will be held accountable. It also raises awareness of the importance of securing internet-connected devices and patching vulnerabilities to prevent them from being exploited by botnets.

## What is email spam and how to fight it?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/spam)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**What is Email Spam?**

Email spam is unsolicited, undesired, or bulk electronic mail messages typically sent to multiple recipients. It can contain advertisements, phishing scams, malware, or other malicious content.

**How to Fight Email Spam:**

**1. Use Spam Filters:**
Most email providers have built-in spam filters that block most unwanted messages. Ensure these filters are enabled.

**2. Be Cautious of Unknown Senders:**
Avoid opening emails from unfamiliar or suspicious senders. If an email looks too good to be true, it probably is.

**3. Don't Click Suspicious Links or Attachments:**
Spam emails often contain malicious links or attachments that can infect your computer or steal your information. Hover over links before clicking to see where they lead.

**4. Unsubscribe from Unwanted Emails:**
Many spam emails include an "unsubscribe" link at the bottom. Use this to opt out of receiving future messages from that sender.

**5. Use Anti-Spam Software:**
Third-party anti-spam software can provide additional protection by blocking emails that bypass built-in filters.

**6. Block Suspicious Email Addresses:**
Most email providers allow you to block specific email addresses. If you receive spam from a particular sender, block their address to prevent future messages.

**7. Use Strong Passwords:**
Weak passwords can make your email account vulnerable to spammers. Create strong, unique passwords for your email and other online accounts.

**8. Report Spam Emails:**
Report spam emails to your email provider or the sender's internet service provider (ISP). This helps identify spammers and improve filtering systems.

**9. Educate Yourself:**
Stay informed about the latest spam trends and techniques. Know how to recognize and avoid spam emails.

**10. Protect Your Personal Information:**
Avoid providing your email address publicly, such as on websites or social media. Only share it with trusted contacts.

**Remember:**

* Spamming is illegal in many countries.
* Never respond to spam emails or click on suspicious links or attachments.
* By taking these precautions, you can significantly reduce the amount of spam you receive.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) is a feature that allows car owners to lock and unlock their vehicles without physically using a key. This is done through the use of a fob or card that emits a radio signal that is detected by the car's antennas. When the car's antennas detect the signal, they will unlock the doors and disarm the alarm. PKE systems also allow for keyless starting, which allows drivers to start their cars without inserting a key into the ignition.

## Multiple Veeam vulns spark concern among defenders
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366610118/Multiple-Veeam-vulns-spark-concern-among-defenders)

Published: Mon, 09 Sep 2024 13:45:00 GMT

**Multiple Veeam Vulnerabilities Pose Serious Threats**

Veeam, a leading provider of data backup and recovery solutions, has recently disclosed multiple critical vulnerabilities in its software that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and disrupt operations. These vulnerabilities have raised significant concerns among cybersecurity defenders.

**Critical Vulnerabilities**

The most concerning vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-21976, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on Veeam backup servers. This could allow attackers to gain complete control over the server, including the ability to steal data, disrupt operations, or install malware.

Another critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-21977, allows attackers to mount denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on Veeam backup servers by sending specially crafted requests. This could disrupt backup operations and prevent organizations from recovering critical data in the event of a system failure or attack.

**Impact and Mitigation**

The impact of these vulnerabilities is significant, as they could enable attackers to compromise sensitive data, disrupt backup operations, and cause financial losses. Veeam has released security patches to address these vulnerabilities, and organizations are strongly advised to apply them immediately.

In addition to patching, organizations should also review their security configurations and consider additional measures to protect their Veeam deployments, such as network segmentation and intrusion detection systems.

**Recommendations for Defenders**

* **Apply patches immediately:** Install the latest security patches from Veeam to address the vulnerabilities.
* **Review security configurations:** Ensure that Veeam backup servers are configured securely, including limiting access and applying firewall rules.
* **Implement network segmentation:** Segregate Veeam backup servers from other critical network resources to minimize the impact of attacks.
* **Deploy intrusion detection systems:** Monitor Veeam backup servers for suspicious activity and respond to potential threats promptly.
* **Consider additional security measures:** Explore additional security solutions, such as two-factor authentication and encryption, to enhance protection.

**Conclusion**

The multiple vulnerabilities in Veeam software highlight the importance of maintaining strong security practices. Organizations must prioritize patching, review security configurations, and implement additional measures to protect their Veeam deployments. By taking proactive steps, organizations can mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity and availability of their data.
