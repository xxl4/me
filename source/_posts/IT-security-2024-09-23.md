## Longstanding Darktrace CEO Poppy Gustafsson to step down
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366610052/Longstanding-Darktrace-CEO-Poppy-Gustafsson-to-step-down)

**Longstanding Darktrace CEO Poppy Gustafsson to Step Down**

After a decade at the helm, Poppy Gustafsson, the CEO of British cybersecurity company Darktrace, has announced her decision to step down.

Gustafsson has been instrumental in the company's growth and success since its founding in 2013. Under her leadership, Darktrace expanded its global presence, grew its customer base, and became one of the most innovative and successful cybersecurity companies.

In a statement, Gustafsson expressed her pride in Darktrace's achievements, saying, "I am enormously proud of what we have built together at Darktrace. It has been an incredible journey, and I am deeply grateful for the trust and support of our customers, partners, investors, and employees."

Gustafsson's departure will take effect in the second half of 2023. The company has not yet announced a successor.

Darktrace is a leading provider of artificial intelligence-based cybersecurity products and services. The company's technology uses unsupervised machine learning algorithms to detect and respond to threats in real-time, without the need for manual tuning or rule-based approaches.

Gustafsson's decision to step down follows a period of rapid growth for Darktrace. In 2021, the company went public on the London Stock Exchange, raising £1.7 billion in the process. Darktrace has also been recognized for its innovation, receiving numerous awards, including the Queen's Award for Enterprise in 2022.

Gustafsson's successor will have the challenge of continuing to drive Darktrace's growth and innovation while also navigating the evolving cybersecurity landscape. The company faces stiff competition from established players as well as emerging startups, and the cybersecurity industry is constantly evolving.

Despite these challenges, Darktrace is well-positioned for continued success. The company has a strong foundation, a loyal customer base, and a talented team of engineers and researchers. Gustafsson's decision to step down will undoubtedly mark a new chapter in the company's history, but Darktrace is poised to remain a leader in the cybersecurity industry for years to come.
