    * Illegal activities, such as hacking, spamming, or copyright infringement
    * Harassing or offensive behavior
    * Transmission of malware or viruses
    * Unauthorized access to data or systems
* **Acceptable uses:**
    * Legitimate business or educational purposes
    * Access to authorized resources
    * Communication with authorized individuals
* **Consequences of non-compliance:**
    * Warnings or reprimands
    * Suspension or termination of access
    * Legal action

**Importance of an AUP:**

* **Legal protection:** An AUP helps organizations demonstrate due diligence in preventing misuse of their systems and protecting against legal liability.
* **Clarity for users:** It provides users with clear expectations and reduces the risk of misunderstandings or disputes.
* **Prevention of misuse:** By outlining prohibited activities, an AUP helps prevent users from engaging in inappropriate or illegal behavior.
* **Maintenance of system integrity:** It protects networks and systems from malicious attacks, unauthorized access, and other threats.

**Compliance and Enforcement:**

AUPs are typically enforced through a combination of monitoring, reporting, and disciplinary action. Users should be informed of the AUP and its consequences prior to gaining access to the system or service.
