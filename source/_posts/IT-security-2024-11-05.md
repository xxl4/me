[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/face-detection)

Published: Thu, 31 Oct 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Face Detection**

Face detection is a computer vision technique that aims to identify and localize human faces in images or videos. It plays a crucial role in various applications, including:

* Authentication and security
* Video surveillance
* Social media tagging
* Human-computer interaction
* Medical imaging

**How Face Detection Works**

Face detection algorithms typically follow these steps:

1. **Preprocessing:** The input image is resized and converted to grayscale for efficiency.

2. **Feature Extraction:** Various features are extracted from the image, such as edges, corners, and local patterns. These features are specific to human faces and help distinguish them from other objects.

3. **Window Sliding:** A sliding window approach is used to scan the image. At each window position, the features are extracted within that window.

4. **Feature Matching:** The extracted features are compared to a database of known face features. Machine learning or deep learning models are used for this matching process.

5. **Window Scoring:** Based on the feature matching results, each window is assigned a score indicating the likelihood of containing a face.

6. **Non-Maximum Suppression:** Overlapping windows with high scores are merged or suppressed to obtain a single bounding box around the face.

**Common Face Detection Techniques**

* **Template Matching:** Compares the input image to a predefined face template.
* **Viola-Jones Method:** Uses Haar-like features and a cascade of classifiers to detect faces.
* **Eigenfaces:** Uses principal component analysis to represent faces in a low-dimensional space.
* **Fisherfaces:** Similar to Eigenfaces, but uses discriminant analysis to maximize class separability.
* **Deep Learning:** Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn rich feature representations and perform face detection.

**Challenges in Face Detection**

Face detection can be challenging due to factors such as:

* Variations in lighting, pose, and expression
* Occlusions (e.g., glasses, hats)
* Changes in facial appearance over time
* Presence of multiple faces in a single image

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/two-factor-authentication)

Published: Mon, 28 Oct 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires two different verification methods to access an account or service. This adds an extra layer of protection beyond just a password, making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access.

**How 2FA Works:**

2FA works by requiring two factors of authentication:

* **Something you know:** Typically a password or PIN.
* **Something you have:** A physical device like a phone, tablet, or security key.

When you log in to an account with 2FA enabled, you will first enter your password. Then, you will be prompted to provide the second factor of authentication, which could be:

* **One-Time Password (OTP):** A unique code sent to your phone via SMS or an authenticator app.
* **Push Notification:** A prompt sent to your phone asking you to approve the login attempt.
* **Security Key:** A physical device that you physically connect to your computer or phone.

**Benefits of 2FA:**

* **Increased Security:** 2FA makes it much harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they know your password.
* **Protection Against Phishing:** Phishing scams that attempt to trick you into giving away your password are less effective with 2FA.
* **Compliance:** Some regulations and standards require the use of 2FA for secure access.
* **Peace of Mind:** Knowing that your accounts are better protected provides peace of mind.

**Examples of 2FA:**

This is the first time that a Saudi dissident has sued the Saudi government in a UK court over the use of spyware. The lawsuit is being supported by the human rights group Amnesty International.

Amnesty International's UK director, Kate Allen, said: "This lawsuit is a landmark case that could set a precedent for holding governments accountable for the misuse of spyware. The Saudi government has a long history of using spyware to target dissidents, and it is vital that they are held to account for these abuses."

The Saudi government has not yet commented on the lawsuit. However, it has previously denied using spyware to target dissidents.

The case is expected to be heard in the UK High Court later this year.

**Danish Government Reinvigorates Cybersecurity Council to Address AI Advancements**

In response to the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on cybersecurity, the Danish government has relaunched its Cybersecurity Council.

**Purpose of the Council**

The Cybersecurity Council aims to strengthen the resilience of Denmark's digital infrastructure and society against cyber threats. It will:

* Monitor and evaluate emerging cybersecurity risks
* Provide strategic guidance to the government on cybersecurity policy
* Enhance collaboration between public and private stakeholders

**AI and Cybersecurity**

The council's renewed focus on AI stems from the potential benefits and risks it poses to cybersecurity. AI can:

* Enhance threat detection and response capabilities
* Automate repetitive cybersecurity tasks
* Improve situational awareness for security analysts

However, AI can also introduce new vulnerabilities:

* AI-powered cyberattacks could become more sophisticated and difficult to detect
* AI bias could lead to false positives and missed threats

**Council Composition**

The council is chaired by the Danish Minister for Industry, Business, and Financial Affairs, Simon Kollerup. Its members include:

* Representatives from government agencies (e.g., the Danish Security and Intelligence Service)
* Cybersecurity experts from academia and the private sector
* International partners

**Next Steps**

The council's first meeting will be held in May 2023, where it will develop a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy for Denmark. The strategy will focus on:

* Leveraging AI to enhance cybersecurity capabilities
* Mitigating the risks associated with AI in cybersecurity
* Strengthening public-private partnerships

**Importance for Denmark**

Denmark is a highly digitized society that relies heavily on digital infrastructure. The relaunch of the Cybersecurity Council demonstrates the government's commitment to safeguarding its digital assets and ensuring the well-being of its citizens in the face of evolving cyber threats.

**Labour's 10-year health service plan will open up data sharing**

Labour has pledged to open up data sharing in the NHS as part of its 10-year plan for the health service.

The party said that it would create a new "data foundation" to make it easier for NHS staff and researchers to access and use data.

This would include data on patient demographics, medical history, and treatment outcomes.

Labour said that this would help to improve the quality of care by allowing doctors and nurses to make better informed decisions about treatment.

It would also help to speed up the development of new treatments and technologies.

The party said that it would also work to ensure that data is used in a responsible and ethical way.

This would include ensuring that patient confidentiality is protected and that data is not used for commercial purposes without consent.

The plan was welcomed by health experts.

Dr Sarah Wollaston, chair of the Health and Social Care Committee, said that it was "a positive step forward."

"Data sharing is essential for improving the quality of care and developing new treatments," she said.

"I hope that this plan will help to make it easier for NHS staff and researchers to access and use data."

However, some privacy campaigners have raised concerns about the plan.

They argue that it could lead to patient data being used without their consent.

Labour said that it would work to ensure that data is used in a responsible and ethical way.

**Tailgating (Piggybacking)**

Tailgating (also known as piggybacking) is an unauthorized method of accessing a secure physical area or network by following closely behind an authorized person who is using valid credentials.

**How it Works:**

* An individual gains access to a protected area or network through legitimate means, such as using an access card or entering a password.
* An unauthorized person (piggybacker) observes the authorized person's entry and follows close behind, without having their own authorization.

**Risks of Tailgating:**

* **Security breaches:** Piggybackers can gain access to sensitive information, systems, or physical assets.
* **Data theft:** Piggybackers may extract valuable data or install malware.
* **Financial fraud:** Access to financial systems can lead to unauthorized transactions or identity theft.
* **Physical harm:** Piggybackers may gain access to restricted areas or weapons posing a potential threat to employees or visitors.

**Prevention Measures:**

* **Physical barriers:** Use turnstiles, gates, or other physical obstacles to prevent unauthorized entry.
* **Credential validation:** Implement two-factor authentication or other measures to verify the identity of the authorized person.
* **Staff awareness:** Train employees to be aware of potential piggybacking attempts and to report suspicious activity.
* **Visitor management:** Establish a clear visitor management policy to track and restrict access for unauthorized individuals.
* **Security technology:** Use surveillance cameras, motion detectors, or other technology to monitor access points.
* **Penalties:** Establish clear consequences for piggybacking attempts to deter unauthorized access.
