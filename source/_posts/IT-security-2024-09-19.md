[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

**Passive Keyless Entry (PKE)**

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) is a vehicle security and convenience feature that allows drivers to unlock, lock, and start their vehicles without using a traditional key fob or key. It utilizes a combination of radio-frequency identification (RFID) and Bluetooth technology to achieve this.

**How PKE Works:**

* **RFID Transmitter:** A small RFID transmitter is embedded in the key fob or card. It contains a unique identification code associated with the vehicle.
* **Receiver Unit:** The vehicle is equipped with a receiver unit that detects signals from the RFID transmitter.
* **Bluetooth Control:** When the driver is in close proximity to the vehicle (typically within a few feet), the Bluetooth module in the key fob or card communicates with the vehicle's Bluetooth controller. This establishes a secure connection.

**Unlocking and Locking:**

* When the driver approaches the vehicle with the PKE fob in their possession, the receiver detects the RFID signal and sends a command to the vehicle's central locking system. This automatically unlocks the doors.
* To lock the vehicle, the driver simply touches a sensor on the door handle or press a button on the key fob. The RFID signal is detected and the doors lock.

**Starting the Engine:**

* To start the engine, the driver sits in the vehicle with the PKE fob or card. The receiver detects the RFID signal and allows the driver to start the engine using the push-button ignition or keyless start system.

**Benefits of PKE:**

* **Convenience:** Drivers can access and start their vehicles without fumbling for keys.
* **Enhanced Security:** PKE systems are less susceptible to theft as they eliminate the need for a physical key.
* **Hands-free:** Drivers can unlock and lock their vehicles while carrying bags or other items.
* **Smart Proximity Unlock:** Some PKE systems automatically unlock the doors when the driver approaches the vehicle, eliminating the need to press a button.

**Multiple Veeam vulns spark concern among defenders**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Veeam Backup & Replication software could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Veeam has released security updates to address the vulnerabilities, which affect versions 11 and 12 of the software.

The most critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-24584, is a remote code execution (RCE) flaw that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. The vulnerability is caused by an input validation error in the Veeam Backup & Replication Web Console.

Another critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-24583, is an authentication bypass flaw that could allow an attacker to access sensitive data without providing valid credentials. The vulnerability is caused by an improper implementation of the authentication mechanism in the Veeam Backup & Replication Web Console.

Veeam has released security updates to address both vulnerabilities. Users are urged to apply the updates as soon as possible.

"These vulnerabilities are a serious concern for organizations that use Veeam Backup & Replication software," said Dustin Childs, head of threat intelligence at Trend Micro. "Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or to disrupt operations."
