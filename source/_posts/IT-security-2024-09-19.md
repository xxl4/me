## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as keyless entry, is a system that allows a person to access a vehicle without using a physical key. The system uses a small transmitter that is carried by the user and a receiver that is installed in the vehicle. When the user approaches the vehicle, the transmitter sends a signal to the receiver. The receiver then unlocks the doors and allows the user to enter the vehicle.

PKE systems are typically used in conjunction with a remote keyless entry (RKE) system. RKE systems allow the user to lock and unlock the doors of the vehicle from a distance. PKE systems add the ability to unlock the doors without having to press a button on the key fob.

PKE systems are a convenient and secure way to access a vehicle. They are particularly useful for people who have their hands full or who are carrying heavy items. PKE systems are also less likely to be lost or stolen than traditional keys.
