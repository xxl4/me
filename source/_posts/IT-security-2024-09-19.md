**Email Spam**

Email spam refers to unsolicited, bulk emails typically sent for commercial or malicious purposes. It often contains deceptive or misleading information, attempts to install malware, or phish for sensitive personal data.

**How to Fight Email Spam**

**1. Use Spam Filters:**
Most email providers have built-in spam filters that automatically detect and block suspicious emails. Ensure your filter settings are up-to-date and enabled.

**2. Be Cautious of Attachments:**
Avoid opening attachments from unknown senders or emails that appear suspicious. Attachments can contain viruses or malware that can compromise your device.

**3. Check Sender Addresses:**
Always verify the sender's email address before opening an email. Legitimate senders will have their organization's domain in the address, not a generic domain or one that doesn't match the company's name.

**4. Use a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
Enable 2FA for your email accounts. This requires you to enter both your password and a verification code, making it harder for spammers to access your inbox.

**5. Report Spam:**
If you receive a spam email, report it to your email provider so they can add the sender to their spam blacklist. This helps train spam filters and prevent similar emails from reaching your inbox.

**6. Use Anti-Spam Software:**
Consider installing an anti-spam software alongside your email client. This software uses advanced algorithms to detect and block spam emails.

**7. Be Aware of Phishing Scams:**
Spammers often send emails that look like they're from legitimate organizations, such as banks or retailers. Be wary of emails asking you to provide personal information or click on suspicious links.

**8. Practice Good Email Habits:**
Avoid sharing your email address publicly and only provide it to trusted sources. Use strong passwords and change them regularly.

**9. Use Domain Name System (DNS) Blocklists:**
Enable DNS blocklists on your internet router or device. These lists block known spam sender domains from sending emails to you.

**10. Educate Others:**
Share information about email spam with others. By educating your friends, family, and colleagues, you can help reduce the number of spam emails they receive.

[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

**Passive Keyless Entry (PKE)**

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) is a vehicle security and convenience system that allows users to enter and start their vehicles without using a traditional metal key. Instead, it relies on a combination of electronic devices and sensors that communicate wirelessly.

**How PKE Works:**

* **Key Fob or Smart Key:** The user carries a key fob or smart key that contains a radio transmitter and a unique identification code.
* **Vehicle Antenna:** The vehicle is equipped with an antenna that transmits and receives radio signals.
* **Door Locks and Proximity Sensors:** Each door handle has sensors that detect the presence of the key fob.
* **Ignition System:** The ignition system is modified to accept input from the key fob or smart key.

**Operation:**

* When a user approaches the vehicle, the key fob or smart key sends a signal to the vehicle antenna.
* The antenna detects the signal and compares the identification code with the one stored in the vehicle's computer.
* If the codes match, the door locks are unlocked automatically, and the user can enter the vehicle.
* To start the vehicle, the user places the key fob or smart key in a designated area inside the vehicle (e.g., a dashboard slot or cupholder) and presses the start button.
* If the key fob or smart key is not present or the identification code does not match, the vehicle's security system will remain active, and the vehicle cannot be started.

**Benefits of PKE:**

* **Convenience:** Eliminates the need to carry and fumble with a metal key, especially in difficult weather conditions.
* **Security:** Enhances vehicle security by preventing unauthorized entry and theft.
* **Hands-free operation:** Allows users to easily enter and start their vehicles without having to remove their key fobs or smart keys.
* **Advanced features:** Some PKE systems include additional features such as remote trunk release, remote start, and keyless locking.
