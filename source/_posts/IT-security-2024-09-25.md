## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE), sometimes referred to as keyless entry or proximity entry, is an automotive security system that allows a vehicle to be unlocked and started without the need for a traditional metal key. 

Instead, PKE systems use a wireless transmitter, typically in the form of a key fob or smart card, that emits a unique signal. When the transmitter is in close proximity to the vehicle, usually within a few feet, the vehicle's sensors detect the signal and unlock the doors and disarm the immobilizer, allowing the vehicle to be started with a push of a button or turn of a knob. 

PKE systems enhance convenience by eliminating the need to fumble with keys, especially in situations like carrying groceries or packages, or approaching the vehicle in the dark. They also add an extra layer of security by preventing unauthorized entry and theft, as the vehicle will not start without the presence of the authorized transmitter.

**UN-backed Cyber Security Report Raises Concerns over Global Preparedness**

A recent report commissioned by the United Nations has underscored significant gaps in cyber security preparedness among nations, leaving them vulnerable to escalating cyber threats.

**Key Findings:**

* **Limited Cybersecurity Awareness:** Many countries lack comprehensive understanding of cyber threats and their potential impact.
* **Insufficient Resources:** Governments allocate insufficient funding and human resources to cyber security initiatives.
* **Weak Collaboration:** There is a lack of coordination between government agencies, law enforcement, and private sector organizations.
* **Immature Cybersecurity Frameworks:** National cyber security strategies and frameworks are often outdated or ineffective.
* **Training Deficiencies:** There is a shortage of qualified cyber security professionals globally.

**Consequences of Preparedness Shortages:**

The report warns that these preparedness deficiencies expose nations to:

* Increased risk of cyberattacks and data breaches
* Economic losses and damage to critical infrastructure
* Erosion of public trust in digital services
* Geopolitical tensions and conflicts

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

The report recommends a range of measures to strengthen global cyber security preparedness, including:

* Enhancing awareness and education about cyber threats
* Increasing investment in cyber security technology and personnel
* Fostering collaboration between government, law enforcement, and private sector
* Developing robust national cyber security frameworks
* Promoting international cooperation and capacity building

**Urgent Call to Action:**

The report urges governments, organizations, and individuals to take immediate action to address these shortfalls. It emphasizes the critical importance of protecting cyberspace and ensuring the resilience of interconnected systems.

**Conclusion:**

The UN-backed cyber security report serves as a wake-up call for nations to prioritize their cyber security preparedness. By addressing these deficiencies, countries can mitigate risks, protect their citizens, and maintain stability in the digital age.

## Cyber workforce must almost double to meet global talent need

**Cyber Workforce Must Almost Double to Meet Global Talent Need**

The global cybersecurity workforce must nearly double in size over the next five years to meet the increasing demand for skilled professionals, according to a new report from (ISC)².

The report, titled "The Cybersecurity Workforce Gap: An International Perspective," found that the global cybersecurity workforce will need to grow from 2.7 million in 2021 to 4.5 million in 2025 to meet the growing demand for cybersecurity services.

The report identified several factors that are driving the demand for cybersecurity professionals, including:

* The increasing number of cyberattacks
* The growing sophistication of cyberattacks
* The increasing use of cloud computing and other technologies that create new security challenges
* The increasing regulation of cybersecurity

The report also found that the global cybersecurity workforce is not evenly distributed. The United States has the largest cybersecurity workforce in the world, with over 1 million workers. However, other countries are struggling to keep up with the demand for cybersecurity professionals.

The report called on governments and businesses to take steps to address the cybersecurity workforce gap. The report recommended that governments invest in cybersecurity education and training programs. The report also recommended that businesses offer competitive salaries and benefits to attract and retain cybersecurity professionals.

"The cybersecurity workforce gap is a serious threat to global security," said David Shearer, CEO of (ISC)². "We need to take action now to address this gap and ensure that we have the skilled professionals we need to protect our networks and data."

Here are some specific steps that can be taken to address the cybersecurity workforce gap:

* **Increase funding for cybersecurity education and training programs.** Governments and businesses should invest in programs that provide cybersecurity training to students and professionals. These programs can help to close the skills gap and ensure that we have a workforce that is prepared to meet the challenges of the future.
* **Offer competitive salaries and benefits to cybersecurity professionals.** Businesses need to offer competitive salaries and benefits to attract and retain cybersecurity professionals. This will help to ensure that we have a workforce that is motivated and committed to protecting our networks and data.
* **Encourage diversity in the cybersecurity workforce.** The cybersecurity workforce is not diverse enough. We need to encourage more women and minorities to pursue careers in cybersecurity. This will help to create a workforce that is more representative of the population it serves.
* **Promote lifelong learning in cybersecurity.** The cybersecurity landscape is constantly changing. We need to encourage cybersecurity professionals to engage in lifelong learning so that they can stay up-to-date on the latest threats and technologies.

By taking these steps, we can help to address the cybersecurity workforce gap and ensure that we have the skilled professionals we need to protect our networks and data.

## Kubernetes disaster recovery: Five key questions

Published: Thu, 12 Sep 2024 11:57:00 GMT

**Five Key Questions for Kubernetes Disaster Recovery**

Kubernetes, a popular container orchestration platform, presents unique challenges for disaster recovery. Here are five key questions to consider:

**1. Which Kubernetes components need to be backed up?**

Identify critical components such as etcd (stateful data store), pods, secrets, and persistent volumes. Determine the backup frequency and retention period required.

**2. How to restore Kubernetes clusters from a backup?**

Establish a process for restoring clusters from different backup types (e.g., full vs. incremental). Test and document the restoration steps to ensure quick recovery.

**3. How to recover applications running on Kubernetes?**

Consider using application-specific backup and restore mechanisms or leverage Kubernetes controllers like StatefulSets to handle data persistence across cluster recovery.

**4. How to ensure data integrity during disaster recovery?**

Implement data validation mechanisms to verify that restored data is consistent and usable. Use checksums or hash values to ensure data integrity.

**5. How to automate disaster recovery processes?**

Automate backup, restoration, and recovery processes using tools like Velero or Kubernetes Operator Framework to reduce manual intervention and improve recovery time.
