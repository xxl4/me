## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE) is a feature that allows a vehicle's doors to be unlocked and started without the use of a physical key. It is also known as keyless access or hands-free access.

PKE systems use radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to communicate between the vehicle and a key fob or key card. The fob or card contains a transponder chip that is embedded with a unique code. When the fob or card is within a certain range of the vehicle, the transponder chip sends a signal to the vehicle's receiver. The receiver then checks the code against a list of authorized codes stored in the vehicle's computer. If the code matches, the vehicle's doors will unlock and the engine will start.

PKE systems are more convenient than traditional key systems because they allow drivers to unlock and start their vehicles without having to fumble for a key. They are also more secure than traditional key systems because they are less likely to be stolen or lost.
