Digital ledgers, such as blockchains, are used to record and maintain financial transactions securely. However, they are vulnerable to cyberattacks, including those that exploit weaknesses in the underlying encryption methods.

**HSBC's Test**

HSBC's test involved connecting two geographically dispersed ledgers using the post-quantum VPN tunnel. The test successfully demonstrated the ability to securely transmit transactions and maintain the integrity of the ledgers.

**Benefits**

The implementation of post-quantum cryptography in VPN tunnels provides several benefits:

* **Enhanced Security:** Protects digital ledgers from attacks using quantum computers.
* **Future-Proofing:** Ensures the resilience of financial systems against future cryptographic threats.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Meets evolving regulatory requirements for protecting sensitive data.

**Significance**

HSBC's successful test marks a significant step in the advancement of post-quantum cryptography for financial applications. It demonstrates the feasibility of integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing infrastructure to protect sensitive financial data.

As quantum computing continues to evolve, the adoption of post-quantum cryptography will become increasingly important for safeguarding digital ledgers and ensuring the integrity of financial systems in the digital age.

## NCSC exposes Chinese company running malicious Mirai botnet
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366611295/NCSC-exposes-Chinese-company-running-malicious-Mirai-botnet)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 13:18:00 GMT

**NCSC Exposes Chinese Company Running Malicious Mirai Botnet**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has exposed a Chinese company, Shenzhen Xiaoqi Technology Co., Ltd. (Xiaoqi), for operating a malicious botnet known as Mirai.

**What is Mirai?**

Mirai is a powerful botnet that infects Internet-connected devices such as routers, cameras, and DVRs. Once infected, these devices become part of a large network controlled by attackers. The attackers can then use the botnet to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which can disrupt online services by flooding them with excessive traffic.

**Xiaoqi's Role**

The NCSC discovered that Xiaoqi was selling Mirai-infected devices to customers in China. The company also provided support to these customers, helping them configure and operate the botnet.

**Scale and Impact**

Xiaoqi's botnet is estimated to have infected millions of devices worldwide. The attackers used it to launch a series of high-profile DDoS attacks, targeting websites and online services in the United States and Europe.

**NCSC's Intervention**

The NCSC, working with international partners, has taken action to disrupt Xiaoqi's operations. The company's infrastructure has been taken down, and its website has been seized. The NCSC has also notified Xiaoqi's customers about the malicious activity and advised them to remove the infected devices.

**Consequences for Xiaoqi**

Xiaoqi faces legal action in several jurisdictions. The company could be fined or shut down, and its executives could face criminal charges.

**Significance**

The NCSC's exposure of Xiaoqi is a significant development in the fight against cybercrime. It shows that governments are willing to take action against companies that support malicious cyber activity. It also highlights the importance of Internet of Things (IoT) security and the need for users to take steps to protect their devices.

**Recommendations**

To protect yourself from Mirai and other botnets, the NCSC recommends:

* Keep your devices updated with the latest security patches.
* Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
* Avoid connecting unknown devices to your network.
* Use a network firewall to block unauthorized access.

## What is email spam and how to fight it?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/spam)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**Email Spam**

Email spam, also known as junk mail or unsolicited bulk email, refers to unsolicited electronic messages sent in large quantities. It is often used to promote products or services, spread malware, or collect personal information.

**How to Identify Spam**

* **From:** Unknown or unrecognizable sender
* **Subject:** Vague, sensational, or misleading
* **Body:** Contains excessive graphics, poor grammar, and spelling errors
* **Attachments:** Unfamiliar file types or executable files (.exe)
* **Links:** Suspicious or hover over to reveal unrelated destinations

**How to Fight Spam**

**1. Use a Spam Filter:**

* Most email providers now offer built-in spam filters that automatically sort incoming emails and move spam to a separate folder.
* Consider using a third-party spam filtering service for additional protection.

**2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**

* 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to enter a code sent to your phone or email when logging into your email account.
* This makes it harder for spammers to access your account and send spam using your address.

**3. Block Spammers:**

* If you receive an email from a known spammer, block their email address in your email settings.
* This will prevent any future emails from them reaching your inbox.

**4. Be Wary of Suspicious Links:**

* Avoid clicking on links in emails from unknown senders.
* If you must click a link, hover over it first to see the actual destination.

**5. Report Spam:**

* Most email providers have a "Report Spam" button. Use it to notify your provider about spam emails.
* This helps improve the spam filters and prevents others from receiving the same spam.

**6. Keep Your Software Updated:**

* Regularly update your operating system, browser, and email client to patch any security vulnerabilities that spammers can exploit.

**7. Use Disposable Email Addresses:**

* Consider creating disposable email addresses for non-essential accounts or when signing up for websites you don't trust.
* This helps prevent spammers from collecting your real email address.

**8. Stay Vigilant:**

* Be cautious of unsolicited emails, especially those that appear to be from legitimate sources.
* Never provide personal information or click on suspicious links.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as proximity keyless entry, is a type of keyless entry system that allows users to enter and start a vehicle without the need for a traditional key. PKE systems use a radio frequency (RF) signal to communicate between the vehicle and a key fob, which is typically carried by the user. When the fob is in close proximity to the vehicle, the RF signal is detected and the vehicle's doors are unlocked and the engine can be started.

PKE systems offer a number of advantages over traditional key systems, including:

* Convenience: PKE systems are much more convenient than traditional key systems, as users do not need to fumble with keys or worry about losing them.
* Security: PKE systems are more secure than traditional key systems, as they are less likely to be stolen or cloned.
* Comfort: PKE systems can be operated from a distance, so users can unlock their vehicles and start their engines without having to leave their seat.
