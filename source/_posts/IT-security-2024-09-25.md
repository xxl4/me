## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as keyless entry, is an advanced automotive security and convenience feature that allows drivers to lock and unlock their vehicles without the need for a traditional metal key. PKE systems use a combination of radio frequency identification (RFID) and sensors to detect the presence of an authorized key or key fob within a certain range of the vehicle.

When the authorized key or key fob is in close proximity to the vehicle, PKE sensors detect its signal and send a message to the vehicle's electronic control unit (ECU). The ECU then verifies the key's authenticity and grants access to the vehicle. This enables drivers to unlock the doors and start the engine without having to physically insert a key into the ignition.

PKE systems provide several advantages over traditional key systems, including:

* **Convenience:** Drivers no longer have to fumble with keys or worry about losing them. They can simply carry the key or key fob in their pocket or purse and gain access to their vehicle with ease.

* **Security:** PKE systems enhance vehicle security by preventing unauthorized access. The vehicle will only unlock if the authorized key or key fob is present, making it more difficult for thieves to gain entry.

* **Comfort:** PKE systems can be combined with other features, such as remote start, allowing drivers to start their vehicles from a distance on cold or hot days.

PKE technology has become increasingly common in modern vehicles, especially in luxury and high-end models. Many manufacturers offer PKE as a standard feature or as an optional upgrade.
