## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE) is a system that allows a person to lock and unlock a vehicle without having to take out a traditional key. The system typically uses a small transmitter fob that emits a unique radio frequency (RF) signal. When the fob is near the vehicle, it will send the signal to the car's computer, which will then unlock the doors. The fob can also be used to lock the doors and open the trunk.

PKE is more convenient than using a traditional key, as it allows the driver to keep the fob in their pocket or purse while they are getting in or out of the vehicle. It is also more secure, as it is much more difficult to steal a vehicle that has a PKE system than one that does not.

PKE systems are becoming increasingly common on new vehicles, and they are expected to become even more popular in the future.
