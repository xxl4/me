**CrowdStrike Incident Highlights the Need to Rethink Cyber**

The recent CrowdStrike incident, in which a sophisticated threat actor breached the company's systems and stole sensitive data, serves as a stark reminder of the evolving cybersecurity landscape. This incident exposes the limitations of traditional security approaches and underscores the need for a paradigm shift in how we protect against cyber threats.

**Limitations of Traditional Security:**

* **Reactive vs. Proactive:** Traditional security measures focus on detecting and responding to threats after they have occurred, rather than preventing them proactively.
* **Point Solutions:** Many organizations rely on a patchwork of point solutions that address specific threats, but lack a comprehensive and integrated approach.
* **Lack of Visibility:** Legacy security tools often lack the visibility and insight necessary to identify emerging threats and understand the full scope of an attack.

**The Evolving Cybersecurity Landscape:**

* **Sophisticated Threat Actors:** Cybercriminals have become increasingly sophisticated in their techniques, using advanced tactics to bypass traditional defenses.
* **Rising Cloud Adoption:** The widespread adoption of cloud computing has expanded the attack surface and created new vulnerabilities.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** Threats are increasingly targeting the supply chain, exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party software and services.

**Rethinking Cyber:**

In light of these challenges, it is clear that we need to rethink our approach to cybersecurity. The following principles should guide our efforts:

* **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement proactive monitoring and detection capabilities to continuously identify and respond to threats in real time.
* **Integrated Security:** Adopt an integrated security platform that combines multiple technologies and capabilities to provide end-to-end protection.
* **Threat Intelligence:** Leverage threat intelligence to gain visibility into emerging threats and better understand the tactics and motivations of threat actors.
* **Zero Trust:** Implement a Zero Trust approach that assumes every access attempt is malicious and requires continuous verification.
* **Cybersecurity Mesh Architecture:** Adopt a distributed and decentralized cybersecurity architecture that enhances resilience and reduces single points of failure.

**Conclusion:**

The CrowdStrike incident is a wake-up call for organizations worldwide. It underscores the need to rethink our cybersecurity strategies and embrace a more proactive, holistic, and resilient approach. By adopting the principles outlined above, we can better protect our data, systems, and operations against the evolving threat landscape. Failure to adapt will leave organizations vulnerable to devastating cyberattacks that could cripple their operations and reputation.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) is a technology that allows you to unlock and start your vehicle without having to use a physical key.

**How PKE Works:**

1. **RFID Tag or Key Fob:** PKE vehicles have an RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tag or key fob. It contains a unique code that identifies you as the authorized driver.
2. **Proximity Sensors:** The vehicle is equipped with proximity sensors that detect the presence of the RFID tag when you approach the vehicle.
3. **Unlocking:** When you get close enough, the proximity sensors will detect the RFID tag and send a signal to the vehicle's computer. The computer then unlocks the doors and turns on the interior lights.
4. **Starting the Engine:** Once inside the vehicle, you can start the engine by pressing a "Start/Stop" button. The button typically requires you to touch or press the clutch or brake pedal for safety.

**Benefits of PKE:**

* **Convenience:** Eliminates the need to fumble for keys, especially when your hands are full.
* **Security:** PKE uses encryption to protect against unauthorized access or key cloning.
* **Keyless Entry:** Allows you to unlock and lock the vehicle without having to use a key, even in low-light conditions.
* **Remote Start:** Some PKE systems also allow you to start the engine remotely, warming up the car or cooling it down before you enter.

**Limitations of PKE:**

* **Battery Dependence:** The RFID tag or key fob relies on a battery, which may need to be replaced periodically.
* **Potential for Interference:** PKE systems can be affected by other devices that emit radio waves, such as cell phones or garage door openers.
* **Limited Range:** The detection range of PKE sensors is typically limited to a few feet from the vehicle.

* Promote diversity and inclusion in the cyber workforce.

**Key Outcomes**

The summit resulted in several key outcomes, including:

* A shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities related to the cyber skills gap.
* A commitment to work together to address the issue on a global scale.
* The establishment of a task force to develop a global strategy.
* The pledge to increase investment in cybersecurity education and training.

**The UK's Role**

The UK has long been recognized as a leader in cybersecurity. The NCSC is a world-renowned center of expertise, and the UK government has made significant investments in cybersecurity research and development. By hosting the summit, the UK demonstrated its commitment to working with other nations to create a more secure cyberspace.

**Next Steps**

The task force established at the summit will continue to coordinate efforts and develop a global strategy to address the cyber skills gap. The summit has also raised awareness of the issue and sparked important conversations among governments, industry, and educational institutions.

As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and reliant on technology, the demand for cybersecurity professionals will continue to grow. The UK's initiative to unite nations in tackling the cyber skills gap is a vital step towards building a safer and more secure future for all.
