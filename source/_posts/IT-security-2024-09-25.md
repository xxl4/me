[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as keyless entry, is a proximity-based access control system that allows a user to unlock and start a vehicle without using a physical key. The system typically consists of a key fob or card that emits a radio frequency (RF) signal that is received by a receiver in the vehicle. When the user approaches the vehicle with the key fob or card, the receiver detects the signal and unlocks the doors. The user can then start the vehicle by pressing a button on the dashboard or by inserting the fob into a designated slot.

PKE systems offer a number of advantages over traditional key-based systems, including:

* Convenience: PKE systems allow users to unlock and start their vehicles without having to fumble with keys, which can be especially convenient when carrying bags or packages.
* Security: PKE systems are more secure than traditional key-based systems, as the RF signal is encrypted and can only be received by the authorized receiver in the vehicle. This makes it much more difficult for thieves to gain access to the vehicle.
* Comfort: PKE systems can be programmed to automatically unlock the doors when the user approaches the vehicle and lock the doors when the user walks away. This feature can be very convenient, especially when the user is carrying a lot of items.

PKE systems are becoming increasingly common on new vehicles, and are expected to eventually replace traditional key-based systems entirely.
