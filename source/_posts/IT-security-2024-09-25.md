## NCSC exposes Chinese company running malicious Mirai botnet
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366611295/NCSC-exposes-Chinese-company-running-malicious-Mirai-botnet)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 13:18:00 GMT

**NCSC Exposes Chinese Company Running Malicious Mirai Botnet**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has published a report exposing a Chinese company, Venustech, as the operator of a malicious botnet called Mirai. The botnet is capable of launching large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which can cripple websites and online services.

**Background on Mirai**

Mirai is a malware that infects internet-connected devices such as routers, webcams, and IP cameras. It can exploit vulnerabilities in these devices to gain control and add them to a botnet, a network of infected devices controlled by a single entity.

**Venustech's Involvement**

According to the NCSC report, Venustech has been operating the Mirai botnet since at least 2018. The company has used the botnet to launch multiple DDoS attacks, including attacks on financial institutions and government agencies in the United States and Europe.

**Key Findings**

* Venustech has been using Mirai to target high-profile websites and services.
* The company has also used the botnet to extort money from victims.
* Venustech's botnet is capable of generating large-scale DDoS attacks with a bandwidth of up to 2.5 terabits per second.
* The company has used multiple internet service providers in China to mask its operations.

**Impact**

The NCSC's exposure of Venustech's involvement in Mirai is significant for several reasons:

* It highlights the growing threat of state-sponsored cybercrime.
* It demonstrates the need for increased cooperation between international law enforcement agencies to combat cybercrime.
* It raises concerns about the vulnerability of internet-connected devices to attack.

**Response**

In response to the NCSC's report, Venustech has denied any involvement in malicious cyber activity. The Chinese government has also stated that it will investigate the allegations.

The NCSC has recommended that organizations take steps to protect themselves from DDoS attacks, including:

* Implementing strong security measures on all internet-connected devices.
* Using DDoS mitigation services.
* Having a response plan in place in case of a DDoS attack.

**Conclusion**

The NCSC's exposure of Venustech's involvement in Mirai is a reminder of the growing threat of state-sponsored cybercrime and the importance of improving cybersecurity measures. Organizations and governments must work together to combat this threat and protect against the potential impact of large-scale DDoS attacks.

## What is email spam and how to fight it?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/spam)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**What is Email Spam?**

Email spam is the unsolicited sending of emails to a large number of recipients, typically for commercial or malicious purposes. It is often used to distribute malware, steal personal information, or promote fraudulent activities.

**Types of Email Spam:**

* **Bulk spam:** Mass emails sent indiscriminately to a large number of recipients.
* **Targeted spam:** Emails that appear personalized but are still unsolicited and malicious.
* **Phishing:** Emails that trick recipients into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details.
* **Malware spam:** Emails that contain malicious attachments or links to infected websites.

**How to Fight Email Spam:**

* **Use a spam filter:** Most email providers have built-in spam filters. Enable and configure these filters to block spam messages.
* **Install antivirus and anti-malware software:** These programs can scan incoming emails for malicious attachments and links.
* **Be cautious when opening attachments:** Never open attachments from unknown senders or suspicious emails.
* **Don't click on suspicious links:** Hover over links before clicking to preview the destination. Avoid clicking on links that lead to unfamiliar websites.
* **Avoid sharing your email address publicly:** Only provide your email address to trusted sources. Avoid posting it on public forums or social media.
* **Report spam:** If you receive a spam email, report it to your email provider. This helps train spam filters and improve detection.
* **Use a separate email address for non-essential tasks:** Create a separate email address for signing up for newsletters, shopping, and other non-critical activities.
* **Consider using third-party email filtering services:** There are specialized services that provide additional spam protection and filtering options.
* **Educate others:** Inform friends, family, and colleagues about the dangers of spam and how to avoid it.

**Additional Tips:**

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

**Passive Keyless Entry (PKE)**

PKE is a vehicle security and convenience feature that allows drivers to enter and start their vehicles without the need for a physical key. It uses a wireless transmitter, typically incorporated into the vehicle's key fob or smartphone, to communicate with the car's sensors.

**How PKE Works:**

* **Unlocking:** When the driver approaches the vehicle with the transmitter, sensors in the vehicle detect the wireless signal from the transmitter.
* **Locking:** The vehicle automatically locks when the driver moves a certain distance away from it with the transmitter in possession.
* **Starting:** Once inside the vehicle, the driver can start the engine by pressing a button or turning a dial without inserting a physical key.

**Benefits of PKE:**

* **Convenience:** Eliminates the need to find, carry, and insert a physical key.
* **Security:** Advanced encryption technology ensures that the wireless signal is secure and not easily intercepted.
* **Enhanced functionality:** PKE can be integrated with other vehicle systems, such as remote start and smartphone apps.
* **Reduced wear and tear:** By eliminating the need for inserting and removing a physical key, it reduces wear and tear on the ignition and lock mechanisms.

**Types of PKE Systems:**

* **Proximity-based:** The transmitter must be within a certain proximity (typically 3-5 feet) of the vehicle to unlock and start it.
* **Remote-based:** The transmitter can be used at a greater distance (up to 30-50 feet) to unlock and start the vehicle.

**Security Considerations:**

While PKE systems are secure, they can be vulnerable to certain attacks, such as:

* **Relay attacks:** Thieves can use signal extenders to amplify the transmitter signal and trick the vehicle into thinking it is near.
* **Code grabbing:** Devices can intercept and record the wireless signals, allowing thieves to access the vehicle later.

Manufacturers address these concerns by employing robust encryption and anti-theft measures, such as rolling codes and immobilizers.
