## NCSC exposes Chinese company running malicious Mirai botnet
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366611295/NCSC-exposes-Chinese-company-running-malicious-Mirai-botnet)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 13:18:00 GMT

**NCSC Exposes Chinese Company Operating Malicious Mirai Botnet**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has identified and exposed a Chinese company involved in operating a malicious Mirai botnet. The botnet, known as Cyclops Blink, has been used to launch large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against various targets, including government agencies, financial institutions, and critical infrastructure.

**Key Findings**

* **Chinese Company Involved:** The NCSC identified a Chinese company, Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology, as the operator of the botnet. Xiongmai is a manufacturer of surveillance cameras and other IoT devices.
* **Exploitation of IoT Devices:** Cyclops Blink exploited vulnerabilities in Xiongmai's IP cameras and other IoT devices to infect and control them.
* **Large-Scale DDoS Attacks:** The botnet has been used to launch DDoS attacks capable of flooding targets with massive amounts of traffic, rendering them inaccessible.
* **Mitigation Efforts:** The NCSC has contacted Xiongmai and other stakeholders to address the vulnerabilities and mitigate the threats posed by the botnet.

**How Cyclops Blink Works**

Cyclops Blink uses a variety of techniques to infect devices and execute DDoS attacks:

* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** The botnet exploits known vulnerabilities in IoT devices, such as weak default passwords and unpatched software.
* **Spreading through Scanning:** Once one device is infected, the botnet uses scanning techniques to spread to other vulnerable devices on the same network.
* **Creating Command and Control Servers:** The infected devices connect to command and control servers operated by the attackers.
* **Launching DDoS Attacks:** Upon receiving commands from the control servers, the infected devices participate in DDoS attacks by flooding targets with traffic.

**Significance of the Exposure**

The exposure of Cyclops Blink is significant because:

* **Threat to Critical Infrastructure:** DDoS attacks can disrupt access to vital services, such as healthcare, banking, and telecommunications.
* **Espionage and Data Theft:** Mirai botnets can be used for espionage and data theft by capturing sensitive information from targeted networks.
* **Attribution of Malicious Activity:** The NCSC's attribution of the botnet to a specific Chinese company raises concerns about the role of state-sponsored actors in cyber threats.

**Mitigation and Prevention**

To mitigate the threats posed by Mirai botnets, organizations and individuals should:

* **Patch Software and Firmware:** Regularly patch IoT devices and other software to address known vulnerabilities.
* **Use Strong Passwords:** Use strong and unique passwords for all IoT devices and online accounts.
* **Install Intrusion Detection Systems:** Implement intrusion detection systems to monitor for suspicious activity and prevent DDoS attacks.
* **Collaborate with Law Enforcement:** Report any suspicious activities or incidents to law enforcement or cybersecurity authorities.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as keyless entry, is a system that allows a car to be unlocked and started without using a key. Instead, a small fob or card is used to send a signal to the car, which then unlocks the doors and allows the engine to be started.

PKE systems use a variety of technologies to communicate with the car, including:

* **Radio frequency identification (RFID):** RFID fobs or cards contain a small chip that stores a unique identification number. When the fob or card is brought close to the car, the car's antenna reads the ID number and unlocks the doors.
* **Bluetooth:** Bluetooth fobs or cards connect to the car's Bluetooth system. When the fob or card is in range, the car's Bluetooth system recognizes it and unlocks the doors.
* **Ultra-wideband (UWB):** UWB fobs or cards use a low-power, short-range wireless communication technology. When the fob or card is in close proximity to the car, the car's UWB system recognizes it and unlocks the doors.

PKE systems are more convenient than traditional key systems because they do not require the driver to remove a key from their pocket or purse. They are also more secure than traditional key systems because they cannot be copied or stolen.

PKE systems are becoming increasingly common on new cars. They are expected to become even more popular in the future as cars become more connected and autonomous.

## Cyber workforce must almost double to meet global talent need
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366610264/Cyber-workforce-must-almost-double-to-meet-global-talent-need)

Published: Fri, 13 Sep 2024 04:45:00 GMT

**Cyber Workforce Must Almost Double to Meet Global Talent Need**

The global cybersecurity workforce must nearly double in size to meet the escalating demand for skilled professionals, according to a new report.

The "Cybersecurity Workforce Study 2023" by Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that the global cybersecurity workforce will grow from 4.7 million in 2023 to 8.6 million by 2030.

This means that an estimated 3.9 million new cybersecurity professionals will need to be hired over the next seven years to keep pace with the growing threat landscape.

The study identifies several factors contributing to the demand for cybersecurity professionals, including:

* **Increasing cybercrime:** The rise of cyberattacks and data breaches has created a surge in demand for cybersecurity experts to protect organizations and individuals.
* **Rapid digitization:** The growing adoption of digital technologies in all industries has expanded the attack surface, increasing the need for cybersecurity professionals to secure these systems.
* **Emerging threats:** The emergence of new cybersecurity threats, such as ransomware and cloud-based attacks, requires specialized skills to mitigate and respond.

The study also highlights regional disparities in cybersecurity talent availability. North America and Europe currently lead in cybersecurity workforce size, but emerging economies such as Asia-Pacific and Latin America are experiencing rapid growth in demand.

To address the cybersecurity talent shortage, the report recommends several strategies, including:

* **Education and training:** Investing in cybersecurity education and training programs to develop the necessary skills and knowledge.
* **Career development:** Providing opportunities for cybersecurity professionals to advance their careers through certifications, mentorship, and on-the-job training.
* **Diversity and inclusion:** Encouraging diversity and inclusion in the cybersecurity workforce to attract a wider pool of candidates.
* **Public-private partnerships:** Collaborating between governments, industry, and academia to address the talent gap.

The report concludes that the global cybersecurity talent shortage is a critical issue that requires immediate attention. By implementing effective strategies, organizations and governments can ensure they have the necessary workforce to protect the digital world from evolving cybersecurity threats.
