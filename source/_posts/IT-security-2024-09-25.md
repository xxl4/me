**Mitigating Security Threats in AI Agents**

**Gartner Overview**

The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) agents has introduced new security challenges to organizations. AI agents can be exploited by malicious actors to compromise systems and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Gartner analysts have identified several key security threats associated with AI agents:

* **Unintentional bias:** AI agents can inherit biases from the data they are trained on, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes.
* **Model poisoning:** Adversaries can manipulate the training data or the AI model itself to cause it to produce inaccurate or harmful outputs.
* **Data poisoning:** Malicious data can be introduced into the training process to mislead the AI agent and make it more susceptible to attack.
* **Adversarial attacks:** Adversaries can craft inputs that are specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the AI agent's algorithms.
* **Black-box attacks:** The opacity of some AI models makes it difficult to analyze and detect potential security risks.

**Mitigation Strategies**

Gartner recommends several strategies to mitigate these security threats:

* **Establish clear governance and oversight:** Implement policies and procedures to define the responsible use of AI agents and monitor their behavior.
* **Use trustworthy data:** Verify the integrity and reliability of the data used to train and operate AI agents.
* **Employ adversarial testing:** Regularly test AI agents using adversarial inputs to identify and address vulnerabilities.
* **Implement security safeguards:** Use encryption, authentication, and access controls to protect AI agents from unauthorized access and manipulation.
* **Monitor and analyze agent behavior:** Use monitoring tools to detect anomalies and identify potential security threats.

**Additional Recommendations**

In addition to Gartner's recommendations, organizations should consider the following:

* **Train security teams on AI:** Ensure that security professionals have the knowledge and skills to identify and mitigate AI-related security risks.
* **Collaborate with AI vendors:** Work with AI vendors to understand the security features and capabilities of their products.
* **Stay up-to-date with security best practices:** Regularly review and implement industry-standard security controls for AI deployments.

By following these mitigation strategies, organizations can reduce the security risks associated with AI agents and ensure their safe and responsible use.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

**Passive Keyless Entry (PKE)**

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) is a technology that allows drivers to unlock and start their vehicles without having to physically touch the key. Instead, the vehicle senses the presence of a compatible key fob or card within a certain range, typically a few feet.

**How PKE Works:**

* A key fob or card contains a small transmitter that emits a low-frequency radio signal.
* The vehicle has sensors, usually located in the door handles and steering column, that detect the signal.
* When the signal is detected, the vehicle unlocks the doors and allows the driver to enter without using a key.
* To start the vehicle, the driver simply presses a button on the dashboard or turns the ignition knob.

**Features and Benefits of PKE:**

* **Convenience:** Drivers don't need to fumble with keys, especially when their hands are full.
* **Security:** PKE systems use rolling codes and other security measures to prevent unauthorized entry.
* **Comfort:** Some PKE systems can also automatically adjust the seat, mirrors, and other settings based on the driver's key fob.
* **Locking/Unlocking Doors Remotely:** PKE key fobs often have a button that allows drivers to lock or unlock the car from a distance.
* **Trunk Release:** Some PKE systems also enable drivers to open the trunk using a button on the key fob.

**Additional Notes:**

* PKE systems require a compatible key fob or card to function.
* The range of PKE signals can vary depending on factors such as the vehicle, obstacles, and environmental conditions.
* PKE systems may not work in areas with high levels of electromagnetic interference.
