## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE) is an electronic system that allows a driver to unlock and start a vehicle without using a traditional metal key. Instead, the driver carries a small key fob that emits a low-frequency signal. When the fob is in close proximity to the vehicle, the system recognizes it and unlocks the doors and allows the driver to start the engine by pressing a button.

PKE systems use a variety of technologies to detect the key fob and communicate with the vehicle. Some systems use radio frequency identification (RFID), while others use Bluetooth or near-field communication (NFC).

PKE systems offer a number of advantages over traditional metal keys. First, they are more convenient, as the driver does not have to fumble with keys to unlock the car or start the engine. Second, they are more secure, as the low-frequency signal is difficult to intercept and copy. Third, PKE systems can be integrated with other vehicle features, such as remote start and door lock/unlock functions.

PKE systems are becoming increasingly common on new vehicles. As the technology continues to improve, it is likely that even more vehicles will be equipped with PKE in the future.
