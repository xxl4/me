**CrowdStrike Incident Highlights the Need to Rethink Cybersecurity**

The recent CrowdStrike incident has shed light on the evolving landscape of cybersecurity and the urgent need for a reevaluation of existing strategies. Here are some key takeaways from the incident and how it should shape our approach to cyber defense:

**1. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Are a Growing Threat:**

The CrowdStrike incident originated with a compromised third-party software vendor, demonstrating the increasing vulnerability of supply chains to cyberattacks. Organizations must prioritize vendor risk management and implement robust measures to assess and mitigate potential threats from external providers.

**2. Traditional Security Measures Are Insufficient:**

The incident exposed the limitations of traditional cybersecurity tools, such as antivirus software, which were unable to detect the sophisticated attack. Organizations need to invest in advanced security solutions, including behavioral analytics, threat intelligence, and automated response capabilities.

**3. Incident Response Must Be Swift and Coordinated:**

CrowdStrike's rapid and effective response to the incident highlights the importance of having a well-defined incident response plan in place. Organizations must establish clear roles, responsibilities, and communication channels to ensure prompt and coordinated action in the event of a cyberattack.

**4. Collaboration and Information Sharing Are Essential:**

The incident reinforced the value of collaboration and information sharing among organizations. By working together, enterprises can identify common threats, share best practices, and collectively strengthen their defenses.

**5. Endpoint Security Requires a Multi-Layered Approach:**

The attack on CrowdStrike emphasized the need for a comprehensive approach to endpoint security. Organizations must implement a combination of protective measures, including endpoint detection and response (EDR), anti-malware, and patch management.

**6. Human Error Remains a Significant Factor:**

The incident also highlighted the importance of addressing human error. Organizations must invest in employee training and awareness programs to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and other social engineering tactics.

**7. Continuous Monitoring and Detection Are Critical:**

The constant evolution of cyber threats requires organizations to maintain continuous monitoring and detection capabilities. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, enterprises can proactively identify and mitigate potential attacks.

**Conclusion:**

The CrowdStrike incident serves as a wake-up call for organizations to rethink their cybersecurity strategies. It underscores the need to address supply chain vulnerabilities, invest in advanced security solutions, prioritize incident response, foster collaboration, implement multi-layered endpoint protection, mitigate human error, and embrace continuous monitoring and detection.

## NCSC exposes Chinese company running malicious Mirai botnet
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366611295/NCSC-exposes-Chinese-company-running-malicious-Mirai-botnet)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 13:18:00 GMT

**NCSC Exposes Chinese Company Running Malicious Mirai Botnet**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a part of the UK government, has disclosed the identification of a Chinese company that is operating a malicious botnet known as Mirai.

**What is Mirai?**

Mirai is a powerful Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) botnet that has been used to launch devastating attacks against major websites and online services. It infects IoT devices such as routers and security cameras, turning them into bots under the control of attackers.

**Chinese Company's Involvement**

The NCSC has determined that a Chinese company called Shenzhen Zhongcheng Lianchuang Technology Co., Ltd. (SZL) is responsible for running the Mirai botnet. SZL has been identified as the command and control server (C2) for the botnet, allowing the attackers to communicate with and control the infected devices.

**Impact of the Botnet**

The Mirai botnet has been used to launch significant DDoS attacks against targets worldwide, including major internet service providers, financial institutions, and government agencies. These attacks can cause websites and online services to become inaccessible or slow, disrupting operations and causing financial losses.

**Evidence Against SZL**

The NCSC gathered evidence linking SZL to the Mirai botnet by analyzing network traffic, identifying the IP addresses of the C2 servers, and tracing them back to SZL's infrastructure. They also obtained information from law enforcement agencies and collaborated with international partners.

**International Collaboration**

The NCSC has shared its findings with law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity organizations around the world. This collaboration is crucial for disrupting the botnet's operations and holding the company responsible accountable.

**Call to Action**

The NCSC urges all organizations and individuals to take the following steps:

* Patch IoT devices regularly and update their firmware.
* Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
* Implement DDoS mitigation measures to protect against attacks.
* Report suspicious activities to the NCSC or other relevant authorities.

**Conclusion**

The NCSC's exposure of the Chinese company operating the Mirai botnet is a significant step towards combating this threat. It highlights the importance of international collaboration and the need for organizations to take proactive measures to protect themselves from DDoS attacks.

* Monitor your email accounts regularly for any suspicious activity.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as keyless access, is a technology that allows a person to unlock and start a vehicle without using a physical key. The system uses a key fob that emits a radio signal to the vehicle's receiver. When the key fob is in close proximity to the vehicle, the receiver will unlock the doors and disarm the alarm. The vehicle can then be started by pressing a button on the dashboard.

PKE is a convenient and secure way to enter and start a vehicle. It eliminates the need to fumble with keys, and it can help to prevent theft. However, it is important to note that PKE systems can be vulnerable to hacking. Therefore, it is important to take steps to protect the system from unauthorized access.
