**CrowdStrike Apologizes to US Government for Global Mega-Outage**

Mountain View, Calif. – CrowdStrike, a leading cybersecurity company, has issued a formal apology to the United States government for a global mega-outage that disrupted operations across multiple federal agencies on July 12, 2023.

The outage, which lasted for over six hours, affected several critical systems, including those responsible for financial transactions, defense communications, and intelligence gathering. The incident is being investigated by CrowdStrike and external cybersecurity experts to determine the root cause and prevent similar incidents in the future.

In a statement released this morning, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said: "We deeply regret the impact this outage has had on our government customers and the critical operations they rely on. We take full responsibility for this incident and are working tirelessly to resolve it as quickly as possible."

According to initial findings, the outage was caused by a software bug in a recent update to CrowdStrike's security platform. The bug disrupted the communication between the platform and its endpoint agents, causing them to become unresponsive.

CrowdStrike has implemented a temporary workaround to mitigate the issue and is working on a permanent fix that will be released as soon as possible. The company has also established a dedicated incident response team to assist affected customers and provide regular updates on the restoration process.

"We understand the importance of cybersecurity to our government customers and are committed to maintaining their trust," said Kurtz. "We will learn from this incident and take all necessary steps to enhance the reliability of our services."

The outage has raised concerns about the growing reliance on third-party cybersecurity vendors by government agencies. Experts argue that such incidents highlight the need for agencies to have robust backup plans in place to ensure continuity of critical operations.

The US government has not yet commented publicly on the outage, but it is likely that it will launch its own investigation and review the security of CrowdStrike and other cybersecurity vendors.

**Gartner: Mitigating Security Threats in AI Agents**

**Key Findings**

* **AI agents are increasingly vulnerable to security breaches.**
* **Organizations must take steps to mitigate these risks.**
* **Gartner recommends a number of best practices for securing AI agents.**

**AI Agents and Security Risks**

AI agents are becoming increasingly common in a wide variety of applications. These agents can perform a wide range of tasks, from simple automation to complex decision-making. However, as AI agents become more sophisticated, they also become more vulnerable to security breaches.

There are a number of reasons why AI agents are vulnerable to security breaches. First, AI agents often rely on data to learn and make decisions. This data can be compromised by attackers, who can then use it to manipulate the agent's behavior. Second, AI agents are often deployed in complex environments, where they may be exposed to a variety of threats. Third, AI agents are often developed by third parties, which can introduce security vulnerabilities.

**Best Practices for Securing AI Agents**

Organizations can take a number of steps to mitigate the security risks associated with AI agents. These steps include:

* **Use secure data sources.** The data used to train and deploy AI agents should be secure from unauthorized access.
* **Deploy AI agents in a secure environment.** AI agents should be deployed in a secure environment that is protected from unauthorized access.
* **Develop AI agents with security in mind.** AI agents should be developed with security in mind. This includes using secure coding practices and implementing security controls.
* **Monitor AI agents for security breaches.** AI agents should be monitored for security breaches. This can be done by using security monitoring tools and by reviewing the agent's logs.
* **Respond to security breaches quickly and effectively.** Organizations should have a plan in place for responding to security breaches. This plan should include steps for isolating the breach, investigating the breach, and remediating the breach.

**Conclusion**

AI agents are powerful tools that can be used to improve a wide range of business processes. However, AI agents are also vulnerable to security breaches. Organizations must take steps to mitigate these risks in order to protect their data and systems.

**NCSC's Investigation**

The NCSC conducted an investigation into the Muhstik botnet and traced its infrastructure to Lianrui. The company is based in Shenzhen, China, and is known for developing and selling IoT devices.

**NCSC's Findings**

The NCSC found that:

* Lianrui was the sole operator of the Muhstik botnet.
* The botnet consisted of over 100,000 infected Huawei HG532 modems.
* Lianrui used the botnet to launch DDoS attacks against target organizations.

**Consequences for Lianrui**

As a result of the NCSC's investigation, Lianrui has been:

* Added to the US Treasury Department's sanctions list.
* Facing criminal charges in the United States.
* Prohibited from doing business with US companies.

**Implications**

The NCSC's exposure of Lianrui has:

* Raised awareness of the threat posed by Chinese state-backed cybercriminals.

* Demonstrated the UK government's commitment to combatting cyber threats.

The NCSC continues to monitor the threat landscape and investigate malicious cyber activity from all sources, including state-backed actors.

## What is email spam and how to fight it?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/spam)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**What is Email Spam?**

Email spam refers to unsolicited and often harmful emails that are sent in bulk to a large number of recipients. These emails may contain malicious content, such as malware, viruses, or phishing attempts, and can be disruptive to productivity and privacy.

**How to Fight Email Spam**

**1. Use a Spam Filter:**
Most email providers offer spam filters that automatically sort incoming emails based on their likelihood of being spam. These filters can be adjusted to suit your specific needs.

**2. Enable Anti-Spam Measures:**
Email clients, such as Microsoft Outlook, often have anti-spam measures in place. Make sure these features are enabled to enhance protection against spam.

**3. Scrutinize Sender Addresses:**
Be cautious of emails from unknown or suspicious sender addresses. Hover over the address to reveal the full email address and identify any irregularities.

**4. Check for Suspicious Content:**
Spam emails often contain grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, or urgent requests for personal information. Avoid clicking on links or opening attachments in such emails.

**5. Use a Disposable Email Address:**
For online services that require you to provide an email address, consider using a disposable email address. This helps protect your primary email address from spam.

**6. Report Spam Emails:**
Most email providers have a "report spam" button. Use this feature to flag spam emails and help train the spam filter.

**7. Unsubscribe from Mailing Lists:**
If you receive unwanted emails from mailing lists, use the "unsubscribe" link to remove your email address.

**8. Educate Yourself:**
Stay informed about common spam techniques and best practices for avoiding them. Share this knowledge with friends and family to raise awareness.

**9. Use a Spam Blocking Service:**
Consider using a third-party spam blocking service that provides additional protection beyond what is offered by email providers.

**10. Be Vigilant:**
Spam filters are not perfect. Monitor your inbox regularly and delete any suspected spam emails to prevent them from becoming a nuisance.
