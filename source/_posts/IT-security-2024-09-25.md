A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is a documented plan that outlines the steps an organization will take to recover and restore critical business functions in the event of a disaster or disruptive event. It provides a roadmap for how the business will continue to operate, protect its critical assets, and meet its obligations to stakeholders. The BCP addresses various aspects of business continuity, including:

**Essential Functions and Operations:**
* Identifies the critical business functions and processes that must be maintained during a disruption.

**Risk Assessment:**
* Analyzes potential threats and vulnerabilities that could impact the business and prioritizes them based on their likelihood and impact.

**Recovery Strategies:**
* Outlines specific recovery strategies for each critical function, including backup plans, alternate sites, and contingency operations.

**Communication and Coordination:**
* Establishes a communication plan for notifying stakeholders, providing updates, and coordinating response efforts.

**Resource Management:**
* Identifies and allocates resources, such as personnel, equipment, and supplies, to support recovery operations.

**Contingency Facilities and Equipment:**
* Determines alternative facilities or equipment that can be used to continue operations if the primary facilities are disrupted.

**Key Contacts and Responsibilities:**
* Lists the key individuals responsible for implementing the BCP and their specific roles and responsibilities.

**Testing and Updating:**
* Outlines a plan for regularly testing the BCP and making updates as needed based on changes in the business, threat landscape, or regulatory requirements.

The goal of a BCP is to minimize the impact of disruptions on an organization's operations and allow it to continue providing essential services to its customers, employees, and other stakeholders. It should be tailored to the specific needs and risks of the organization and reviewed and updated regularly to ensure its effectiveness.

**NCSC Exposes Chinese Company Running Malicious Mirai Botnet**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has exposed a Chinese company, Shenzhen Shanghaijing Technology Co. Ltd, for running a malicious botnet called Mirai.

**Mirai Botnet**

Mirai is a malware that infects IoT (Internet of Things) devices, such as routers and cameras, and turns them into bots. These bots are then used to launch coordinated DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, which can overwhelm websites and online services with traffic, making them inaccessible.

**Shenzhen Shanghaijing Technology Co. Ltd**

Shenzhen Shanghaijing Technology Co. Ltd is a Chinese company that provides IoT security products and services. However, the NCSC has found that the company is also operating a Mirai botnet.

**NCSC's Investigation**

The NCSC conducted an investigation and identified thousands of Mirai-infected devices that were being used to launch DDoS attacks. The investigation also revealed that Shenzhen Shanghaijing Technology Co. Ltd was the command-and-control center for the botnet.

**NCSC's Actions**

The NCSC has taken action to disrupt the Mirai botnet, including:

* Sharing intelligence with international partners
* Issuing warnings to IoT device owners
* Helping victims of DDoS attacks

**Impact of the Exposure**

The NCSC's exposure of Shenzhen Shanghaijing Technology Co. Ltd has significant implications:

* **Increased awareness:** The exposure has raised awareness about the threat posed by Mirai and other IoT botnets.
* **Potential sanctions:** The United States and other countries may consider imposing sanctions on Shenzhen Shanghaijing Technology Co. Ltd for its involvement in cybercrime.
* **Increased pressure on China:** The exposure puts pressure on China to address malicious cyber activity originating from within its borders.

**Recommendations from NCSC**

The NCSC recommends that IoT device owners take the following steps to protect themselves from Mirai and other botnets:

* **Update firmware:** Keep IoT devices up to date with the latest firmware to patch security vulnerabilities.
* **Use strong passwords:** Use strong and unique passwords for IoT devices.
* **Enable two-factor authentication:** Enable two-factor authentication for IoT devices where possible.
* **Segment IoT devices:** Isolate IoT devices on a separate network segment from other devices on your home network.

## What is email spam and how to fight it?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/spam)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**What is Email Spam?**

Email spam refers to unsolicited bulk emails sent to recipients who have not consented to receive them. It often contains malicious content, such as viruses, malware, or phishing attempts. Spam emails can be highly annoying, disruptive, and potentially dangerous.

**How to Fight Email Spam**

**1. Use Reputable Email Providers:**
Choose email providers that offer robust spam filters, such as Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo Mail. These providers use advanced algorithms to automatically detect and block spam emails.

**2. Turn on Spam Filters:**
Enable the spam filters provided by your email provider. Most email services have built-in spam filters that can be adjusted to your preferred level of sensitivity.

**3. Be Careful When Sharing Your Email Address:**
Avoid providing your email address on public websites or to unknown recipients. Use a separate email address for less important accounts or online registrations.

**4. Avoid Opening Suspicious Emails:**
Do not open emails from unknown senders, especially if they have suspicious sender names, subject lines, or attachments. Delete these emails immediately.

**5. Hover over Links Before Clicking Them:**
Before clicking on links in emails, hover your mouse over them to check the actual destination URL. If the URL is different from what the email claims, do not click on it.

**6. Report Spam Emails:**
Report spam emails to your email provider by using the "Report as Spam" or "Mark as Junk" features. This helps email providers improve their spam filters.

**7. Use Third-Party Anti-Spam Software:**
Consider using third-party anti-spam software or browser extensions that can filter and block spam emails even before they reach your inbox.

**8. Practice Good Password Hygiene:**
Use strong passwords and change them regularly. Compromised passwords can be used by spammers to send emails from your account.

**9. Educate Yourself:**
Stay informed about the latest spam trends and techniques. This will help you recognize and avoid spam emails more effectively.

**10. Be Vigilant:**
Spammers are constantly evolving their methods. Be vigilant and always be on the lookout for suspicious emails. If you're ever unsure about an email, it's best to err on the side of caution and delete it.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

**Passive Keyless Entry (PKE)**

PKE is a vehicle access and starting system that allows the driver to unlock and start the vehicle without physically using a key fob or key.

**How PKE Works:**

* A key fob with an embedded radio frequency (RF) transmitter is carried by the driver.
* As the driver approaches the vehicle, the key fob transmits a signal to the vehicle's sensors.
* The sensors detect the signal and verify that the key fob is authorized to access the vehicle.
* If authorized, the vehicle unlocks the doors and allows the driver to enter without physically inserting a key.
* To start the vehicle, the driver typically presses a button or steps on the brake pedal while holding the key fob in the vehicle.

**Benefits of PKE:**

* **Convenience:** Drivers can access and start their vehicles without ever taking out the key fob.
* **Security:** PKE systems use encrypted signals and rolling codes to prevent unauthorized entry or remote starting.
* **Keyless ignition:** Drivers can start the vehicle without inserting a key into the ignition.
* **Enhanced theft deterrent:** As PKE systems do not require a traditional key, they reduce the risk of theft by key duplication or breaking into the vehicle.

**Additional Features:**

* **Remote starting:** PKE systems often include remote starting functionality, allowing drivers to start their vehicles from a distance using the key fob.
* **Trunk release:** Some PKE systems include a trunk release feature that allows drivers to open the trunk without using a key or remote.
* **Smart access:** PKE systems can be integrated with other vehicle systems, such as Bluetooth and smartphone apps, for even more convenience and functionality.
