## CrowdStrike incident shows we need to rethink cyber
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/CrowdStrike-incident-shows-we-need-to-rethink-cyber)

Published: Fri, 20 Sep 2024 09:17:00 GMT

**The CrowdStrike Incident: A Wake-Up Call**

The recent CrowdStrike incident, where hackers compromised the company's software and accessed sensitive client information, has exposed a critical vulnerability in our cybersecurity posture. It underscores the need to rethink our approach to cyber defense.

**Rethinking Response Mechanisms**

Traditional incident response strategies often fail to keep up with the speed and sophistication of modern cyberattacks. We need to adopt a more proactive and collaborative approach.

* **Real-Time Threat Intelligence Sharing:** Promote the sharing of threat intelligence between organizations, allowing them to identify and mitigate risks faster.
* **Automation and Orchestration:** Automate security processes and integrate different tools to streamline incident detection and response.
* **Cybersecurity Mesh Architectures:** Implement a decentralized cybersecurity approach where multiple security layers work together to provide comprehensive protection.

**Beyond Detection and Response**

Cybersecurity should not only focus on detecting and responding to threats. We need to adopt a more proactive stance that includes:

* **Zero Trust Approach:** Implement policies that assume no inherent trust and require authentication for all access, reducing the impact of compromised credentials.
* **Proactive Threat Hunting:** Conduct regular searches for potential threats that evade traditional detection mechanisms.
* **Security Engineering:** Build systems with security principles embedded from the design phase to reduce vulnerabilities.

**A Holistic Approach**

Cybersecurity should not be treated as an isolated domain. It requires collaboration across the entire organization:

* **Employee Education and Awareness:** Train employees on cyber threats and best practices to minimize human error.
* **Supply Chain Security:** Assess the security posture of vendors and partners to ensure they do not become points of entry for cybercriminals.
* **Cybersecurity as a Continuous Process:** Regularly review and update security measures to stay ahead of evolving threats.

**Conclusion**

The CrowdStrike incident is a stark reminder that our cybersecurity posture is inadequate. We need to rethink our approach and adopt more proactive, collaborative, and holistic strategies. By embracing emerging technologies, strengthening our defenses, and fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness, we can build a more secure digital landscape for all.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as keyless entry, is a system that allows a person to unlock and start a vehicle without using a traditional key. Instead, a key fob or smartphone app is used to send a signal to the vehicle, which then unlocks the doors and allows the engine to be started. PKE systems are often used in conjunction with other security features, such as an alarm system and an immobilizer.

There are several different types of PKE systems available, but they all work on the same basic principle. When the key fob or smartphone app is in close proximity to the vehicle, it sends a signal to the car's antenna. The antenna then relays the signal to the vehicle's electronic control unit (ECU), which confirms that the key is authorized to unlock the car. Once the key is authorized, the ECU sends a signal to the door locks, which unlock.

The key fob or smartphone app can also be used to start the vehicle. When the driver presses the start button, the key fob or smartphone app sends a signal to the ECU, which confirms that the key is authorized to start the car. Once the key is authorized, the ECU sends a signal to the starter motor, which starts the engine.

PKE systems are a convenient and secure way to unlock and start a vehicle. They are more convenient than traditional keys, as they do not need to be inserted into a lock or turned in an ignition. PKE systems are also more secure than traditional keys, as they are less likely to be lost or stolen.
