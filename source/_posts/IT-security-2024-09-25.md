## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive keyless entry (PKE), also known as keyless entry or proximity entry, is an automotive security system that enables a person to unlock and start a vehicle without using a traditional metal key. It utilizes proximity sensors and wireless technology to verify the presence of an authorized device, typically a key fob or smartphone, and grant access to the vehicle. Here's how PKE systems generally work:

1. Proximity Detection: PKE systems have proximity sensors located within or around the vehicle's exterior, such as in the door handles or door pillars. When an authorized device, usually a key fob, is brought within a certain range of the vehicle (typically a few feet), the proximity sensors detect its presence.

2. Signal Exchange and Verification: The authorized device, such as the key fob, transmits a wireless signal to the vehicle. This signal may contain encrypted data or a rolling code, which is a unique code that changes frequently to enhance security. The vehicle's receiver receives this signal and verifies its authenticity by matching it with stored information in the vehicle's computer system.

3. Access Granted: If the signal verification is successful, the PKE system grants access to the vehicle. It unlocks the doors, allowing the user to enter without inserting a physical key. In some systems, the vehicle's engine can also be started by pressing a dedicated start button or performing a specific action, such as placing the authorized device in a designated area within the vehicle.

4. Passive Locking: Once the authorized device is removed from the vehicle's vicinity (out of range of the proximity sensors), the doors automatically lock, providing added security and convenience.
