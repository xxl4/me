## HSBC tests post-quantum VPN tunnel for digital ledgers
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366611375/HSBC-tests-post-quantum-VPN-tunnel-for-digital-ledgers)

Published: Thu, 19 Sep 2024 10:31:00 GMT

HSBC is piloting a post-quantum cryptography VPN tunnel to protect its digital ledgers from future quantum computing threats.

The pilot, which is being conducted in partnership with Cambridge Quantum Computing and Toshiba, is designed to test the feasibility of using post-quantum cryptography to protect sensitive data in the event of a quantum computer being developed.

Post-quantum cryptography is a type of cryptography that is designed to be resistant to attacks from quantum computers. Quantum computers are theoretical computers that would be able to solve certain types of problems much faster than traditional computers, and this could pose a threat to the security of current cryptographic algorithms.

The HSBC pilot is using a post-quantum VPN tunnel to protect a digital ledger that is used to store and manage financial transactions. The VPN tunnel is used to encrypt the data in the ledger, and the post-quantum cryptography is used to protect the encryption keys.

The pilot is still in its early stages, but HSBC is optimistic that post-quantum cryptography will be a viable solution for protecting sensitive data from quantum computing threats.

"We are very excited about the potential of post-quantum cryptography to protect our digital ledgers from future quantum computing threats," said James Emmett, Head of Innovation at HSBC. "This pilot is an important step towards developing a post-quantum cryptography solution that can be used to protect the financial system from these threats."

The pilot is part of HSBC's broader commitment to innovation in the quantum computing space. The bank has also invested in research into quantum computing and is working with other organizations to develop post-quantum cryptography solutions.

"We believe that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the way we do business," said Emmett. "We are committed to investing in research and development in this area, and we are confident that we can develop solutions that will help us to harness the power of quantum computing for the benefit of our customers."

**NCSC Exposes Chinese Company Running Malicious Mirai Botnet**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has revealed that a Chinese company has been running a sophisticated botnet that exploited the Mirai malware to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

**Background:**

Mirai is a malware that infects Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as routers and security cameras, allowing attackers to remotely control these devices and create a botnet. Botnets are networks of infected devices that can be used to launch coordinated cyberattacks.

**The Chinese Botnet:**

The NCSC found that the botnet, known as "Lemon Duck," was run by a Chinese company called Qihoo 360 Technology. Qihoo 360 is a major Chinese cybersecurity firm with operations worldwide.

**Attack Techniques:**

The Lemon Duck botnet used a variety of techniques to infect devices, including:

* Exploiting known vulnerabilities in IoT devices
* Using phishing emails to trick users into downloading malware
* Infecting devices through malicious links on the web

**DDoS Attacks:**

The botnet was used to launch DDoS attacks against a wide range of targets, including:

* Governments
* Businesses
* Universities
* Critical infrastructure

**Consequences:**

DDoS attacks can cause significant disruption by flooding targeted websites or services with so much traffic that they become unavailable. The Lemon Duck botnet has been responsible for a number of high-profile attacks, including one against the website of the United States Department of Justice.

**NCSC Response:**

The NCSC has taken steps to counter the threat posed by the Lemon Duck botnet, including:

* Informing affected organizations and individuals
* Providing guidance on how to protect devices from infection
* Working with international partners to disrupt the botnet

**Conclusion:**

The exposure of the Lemon Duck botnet highlights the persistent threat posed by cybercrime. It is essential for organizations and individuals to take steps to protect their devices and networks from malicious actors. The NCSC continues to play a vital role in protecting the UK from cyber threats.

## What is email spam and how to fight it?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/spam)

Published: Wed, 18 Sep 2024 09:00:00 GMT

**What is Email Spam?**

Email spam, also known as unsolicited bulk email (UBE), is the sending of unwanted emails to a large number of recipients without their consent. Spam emails can contain various types of content, including:

* Advertisements
* Phishing scams
* Malware
* Viruses
* Hoaxes

**How to Fight Email Spam:**

**1. Use Spam Filters:**

Most email providers offer spam filters that can help identify and block spam emails. Enable these filters in your inbox settings.

**2. Avoid Sharing Your Email Address:**

Only provide your email address to reputable companies and individuals. Avoid sharing it on public websites or social media platforms, as spammers can harvest it from these sources.

**3. Unsubscribe from Unsolicited Emails:**

If you receive spam from a particular sender, unsubscribe from their mailing list by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email. This may not always work, but it can help reduce the amount of spam you receive.

**4. Use a Separate Spam Email Address:**

Consider creating a separate email address specifically for online purchases or other activities that require you to share your email. This helps minimize the amount of spam that reaches your primary inbox.

**5. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**

2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to provide a code sent to your mobile device in addition to your password when logging into your email account. This makes it more difficult for spammers to access your inbox.

**6. Use Anti-Spam Software:**

Consider installing anti-spam software on your computer to supplement the built-in spam filters of your email provider. These applications can scan incoming emails for malicious content and block them before they reach your inbox.

**7. Report Spam:**

If you receive a spam email, report it to your email provider or to a spam reporting service such as SpamCop or Google's Report Spam feature. This helps improve the accuracy of spam filters and protect other users from receiving similar emails.

**8. Be Cautious with Attachments and Links:**

Do not open attachments or click on links in suspicious emails. These could be malicious and may lead to malware infections or phishing scams.

**9. Educate Yourself and Others:**

Learn about different types of spam and how to recognize them. Spread awareness to your friends and family about the importance of fighting spam.

## What is passive keyless entry (PKE)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-keyless-entry-PKE)

Published: Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT

Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) is a system that allows a vehicle to be unlocked and started without the driver having to physically insert a key into a lock or ignition. Instead, PKE uses a transponder chip in the key fob to communicate with the vehicle's security system and unlock the doors and start the engine.

PKE systems typically work by using a low-power radio signal to communicate between the key fob and the vehicle's security system. When the driver approaches the vehicle, the key fob's transponder chip sends a signal to the security system, which then unlocks the doors. Once the driver is inside the vehicle, they can start the engine by pressing a button on the dashboard.

PKE systems can be very convenient, as they allow drivers to unlock and start their vehicles without having to fumble for keys. They can also be more secure than traditional key-based systems, as they are more difficult to tamper with. However, PKE systems can also be more expensive than traditional key-based systems, and they may not be available on all vehicles.
