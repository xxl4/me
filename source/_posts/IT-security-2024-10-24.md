[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366614412/Democracy-campaigner-to-sue-Saudi-Arabia-over-Pegasus-and-QuaDream-spyware-in-UK-court)

Published: Wed, 23 Oct 2024 05:00:00 GMT

**London court set to hear case against Saudi Arabia over use of Israeli spyware**

A prominent democracy campaigner is set to sue Saudi Arabia in a UK court over allegations that the country used Israeli spyware to hack his phone and target dissidents around the world.

Yahya Assiri, a Saudi exile who has been critical of the Saudi regime, is claiming that the Saudi government used Pegasus and QuaDream spyware to hack his phone and steal his data. He is also alleging that the Saudi government used the spyware to target other dissidents, including journalists, activists and human rights defenders.

The case is being brought in the High Court in London and is due to be heard in May. It is believed to be the first time that a Saudi citizen has sued the country in a UK court over the use of spyware.

Assiri's lawyers argue that the Saudi government's use of spyware is a violation of his privacy and freedom of expression. They also argue that the spyware was used to target dissidents who were exercising their legitimate right to freedom of speech.

The Saudi government has not yet responded to the allegations. However, in the past, the country has denied using spyware to target dissidents.

The case is being closely watched by human rights groups and activists. It is seen as a test case for the use of spyware by authoritarian regimes to target dissidents.

**What is Pegasus and QuaDream spyware?**

Pegasus and QuaDream are two types of spyware that are developed and sold by Israeli companies. Pegasus is a particularly powerful spyware that can be used to access a target's phone and steal their data. QuaDream is a less powerful spyware that can be used to track a target's location and monitor their communications.

**Saudi Arabia's use of spyware**

Saudi Arabia has been accused of using spyware to target dissidents for several years. In 2018, it was reported that the Saudi government had used Pegasus to hack the phone of the murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

In 2020, it was reported that the Saudi government had used QuaDream to track the location of the Saudi exile Saad al-Jabri.

The Saudi government has denied these allegations, but the evidence suggests that the country is using spyware to target dissidents.

**The UK court case**

Assiri's case is the first time that a Saudi citizen has sued the country in a UK court over the use of spyware. The case is due to be heard in May and is being closely watched by human rights groups and activists.

If Assiri wins his case, it could set a precedent for other dissidents to sue the Saudi government over the use of spyware. It could also put pressure on the Saudi government to stop using spyware to target dissidents.

**Internet Archive Web Historians Targeted by Hacktivist Cyber Attack**

**Background:**

The Internet Archive, a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving and providing access to online content, has been the target of a cyber attack by hacktivists.

**Attack Details:**

The attack was launched on January 18, 2023, and involved multiple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks targeting the Internet Archive's website and servers. The DDoS attacks flooded the servers with fake traffic, making them inaccessible to legitimate users.

**Hacktivist Motive:**

The hacktivists responsible for the attacks claim to be part of a group called "Guardians of Freedom." They have accused the Internet Archive of "censoring" content and "destroying evidence" of wrongdoing by certain individuals and organizations.

**Impact on Web Historians:**

The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine is a crucial tool for web historians and researchers, as it allows them to access archived versions of websites that may no longer be online. The DDoS attacks have disrupted this service, making it difficult for historians to conduct their work.

**Response from Internet Archive:**

The Internet Archive has condemned the attacks and vowed to continue preserving online content. The organization has implemented mitigation measures to protect its systems from further DDoS attacks.

**Ongoing Investigation:**

Law enforcement agencies are investigating the cyber attacks and attempting to identify the individuals responsible. The FBI has been contacted for assistance.

**Implications:**

The Internet Archive attack highlights the growing threat to organizations that preserve and provide access to online content. Hacktivists are increasingly targeting such organizations in an effort to suppress information or manipulate historical narratives.

**Recommendations for Web Historians:**

Web historians are recommended to take the following measures to protect their work from similar attacks:

* Back up archived content regularly.
* Use multiple storage locations to prevent loss in case of a single attack.
* Collaborate with other organizations to ensure redundancy and resilience.
* Advocate for the importance of preserving online content and the role of web historians.
