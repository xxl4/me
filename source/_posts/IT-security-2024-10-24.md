[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/tailgating-piggybacking)

Published: Thu, 17 Oct 2024 18:01:00 GMT

**Tailgating (Piggybacking)**

Tailgating, also known as piggybacking, is an unauthorized method of gaining access to a protected area or system by following closely behind an authorized person who opens a door, gate, or access point. The unauthorized individual "piggybacks" on the access of the authorized person.

**How it Works:**

* The unauthorized person waits near an access point until an authorized person approaches and uses their credentials to open the door or gate.
* The unauthorized person quickly follows behind the authorized person, taking advantage of the open door before it closes.
* This method exploits the fact that access control systems often do not have a mechanism to differentiate between authorized and unauthorized individuals once the access point is open.

**Risks and Consequences:**

* Security breach: Tailgating can allow unauthorized individuals to gain access to sensitive areas or systems.
* Data theft: Tailgaters could potentially access confidential data or steal devices.
* Physical harm: Tailgaters could harm employees or other authorized individuals within the protected area.

**Prevention Measures:**

* Employ access control systems that require multi-factor authentication or biometrics.
* Install anti-tailgating systems, such as sensors that detect unauthorized individuals behind authorized persons.
* Educate employees about the risks of tailgating and train them to be vigilant in observing and challenging suspicious individuals.
* Consider limiting employee access to sensitive areas only when necessary.
* Implement policies and procedures for reporting any suspected tailgating attempts.

Threat intelligence is the structured and continuous process of gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information about potential threats to an organization. Its purpose is to provide decision-makers with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions about how to protect their assets and mitigate risks.

Threat intelligence can come from a variety of sources, including:

* **Internal sources:** Security logs, incident reports, vulnerability assessments, and employee interviews
* **External sources:** Publicly available information, such as news articles, social media posts, and security advisories
* **Commercial sources:** Threat intelligence vendors and research firms

Once gathered, threat intelligence is analyzed to identify patterns and trends, and to assess the likelihood and potential impact of threats. This information is then disseminated to decision-makers in a timely and actionable manner.

Threat intelligence is an essential component of any effective security program. By providing decision-makers with the knowledge they need to understand and respond to threats, it helps organizations to reduce their risk of being victimized by cyberattacks and other security incidents.
