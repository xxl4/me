Published: Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:57:00 GMT

Endpoint detection and response (EDR) is a cybersecurity solution that detects and responds to threats on endpoints such as laptops, desktops, and servers. EDR systems use a variety of techniques to detect threats, including:

* **Signature-based detection:** EDR systems can detect threats by matching known malicious signatures to files and processes on endpoints.
* **Heuristic-based detection:** EDR systems can detect threats by analyzing the behavior of files and processes on endpoints and looking for suspicious activity.
* **Machine learning-based detection:** EDR systems can use machine learning to detect threats by identifying patterns in data that are indicative of malicious activity.

Once a threat has been detected, EDR systems can take a variety of actions to respond, including:

* **Blocking the threat:** EDR systems can block threats by preventing them from executing or accessing data.
* **Quarantining the threat:** EDR systems can quarantine threats by moving them to a separate location where they cannot harm the endpoint.
* **Deleting the threat:** EDR systems can delete threats if they are deemed to be malicious.

EDR systems can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud. On-premises EDR systems are installed on the endpoints themselves, while cloud-based EDR systems are hosted on a remote server.

EDR systems are an important part of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. By detecting and responding to threats on endpoints, EDR systems can help to protect organizations from data breaches, malware attacks, and other cyber threats.
