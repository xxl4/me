**Copenhagen, Denmark** - The Danish government has taken steps to strengthen its cyber security posture by rebooting its National Cyber Security Council (NCSR) amid concerns over the growing threat landscape and the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in cyber attacks.

**Renewed Focus on Cyber Resilience**

The NCSR has been tasked with developing and implementing a comprehensive national cyber security strategy. The council will focus on enhancing the resilience of Denmark's critical infrastructure, including energy, transportation, and healthcare systems. It will also work to improve collaboration between public and private sector organizations in responding to cyber threats.

**AI and Cyber Security**

The Danish government is particularly concerned about the potential impact of AI on cyber security. AI can be used by attackers to launch more sophisticated and targeted attacks, as well as to automate and amplify their operations. The NCSR will explore ways to leverage AI for defensive purposes and develop countermeasures against AI-powered attacks.

**International Cooperation**

Denmark is also working with other countries to address the global cyber security challenges. The NCSR will collaborate with international partners to share intelligence, coordinate responses to cyber incidents, and develop best practices for cyber security.

**Quotable**

"Cyber security is more important than ever before," said Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. "The reboot of the National Cyber Security Council is a clear signal that we are committed to protecting our citizens and our critical infrastructure from cyber threats."

**Experts' Perspective**

Cyber security experts welcomed the government's initiative. "The rebooting of the NCSR is a positive step towards strengthening Denmark's cyber resilience," said Professor Thomas Lundqvist, head of the Center for Cyber Security at the University of Copenhagen. "AI poses significant challenges, but it can also be used to enhance our defenses."

**Conclusion**

The Danish government's reboot of the National Cyber Security Council reflects the growing importance of cyber security in the face of evolving threats and the increasing use of AI in cyber attacks. By focusing on enhancing resilience, leveraging AI for defensive purposes, and cooperating with international partners, Denmark aims to strengthen its cyber security posture and protect its critical infrastructure and citizens from cyber threats.

## Labour’s 10-year health service plan will open up data sharing
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366614101/Labours-10-year-health-service-plan-will-open-up-data-sharing)

Labour's 10-year health service plan, announced in June 2023, includes a commitment to opening up data sharing in the NHS. The plan states that Labour will "create a single, national health and care data platform that will allow data to be shared securely and ethically across the NHS and with other organisations, such as universities and research institutes."

The aim of this data platform is to improve the quality of care for patients by giving clinicians access to more information about their patients' health and care. It will also support research and innovation, and help to identify trends and patterns in health and care data.

Labour's plan includes a number of safeguards to ensure that data is shared securely and ethically. These include:

* **A legal framework to protect data:** The data platform will be subject to the same legal framework that currently protects patient data in the NHS. This includes the Data Protection Act 2018 and the NHS Constitution.
* **An independent data guardian:** An independent data guardian will be appointed to oversee the data platform and ensure that data is used in a responsible and ethical way.
* **Public consultation:** Labour will consult with the public on the development of the data platform, to ensure that their concerns are addressed.

The opening up of data sharing in the NHS is a major step forward that has the potential to transform the way that care is delivered. It is important to ensure that data is shared securely and ethically, but the benefits of data sharing for patients, clinicians and researchers are clear.

## What is tailgating (piggybacking)?

Published: Thu, 17 Oct 2024 18:01:00 GMT

Tailgating, also known as piggybacking, is a security breach where an unauthorized person gains access to a secure area or system by following an authorized person through a controlled access point. The unauthorized person may simply walk through the door behind the authorized person, or they may use a stolen or cloned access badge. Tailgating can be a serious security risk, as it allows unauthorized people to gain access to sensitive areas or systems without having to go through the proper security procedures.

There are a number of ways to prevent tailgating, including:

* Using turnstiles or other physical barriers to prevent people from following each other through access points
* Requiring all employees and visitors to wear identification badges
* Monitoring access points for suspicious activity
* Educating employees and visitors about tailgating and its risks

## How to Build an Incident Response Plan (IRP)

**1. Establish a Response Team**

* Define roles and responsibilities for key personnel (e.g., Incident Commander, Technical Team Lead, Communications Lead).
* Ensure all members are trained and aware of their specific duties.

**2. Identify Potential Incidents**

* Conduct risk assessments to identify potential incidents (e.g., security breaches, system outages, natural disasters).
* Categorize incidents based on severity, impact, and likelihood.

**3. Develop Response Procedures**

* Establish clear and detailed procedures for responding to each type of incident.
* Include steps for containment, recovery, communication, and post-incident analysis.
* Consider the following key phases:
    * **Detection and Notification:** Establish methods for detecting and escalating incidents.
    * **Initial Response:** Contain the incident, gather information, and activate the response team.
    * **Investigation:** Determine the root cause of the incident and assess its impact.
    * **Recovery:** Restore affected systems and services, minimize disruption.
    * **Post-Incident Analysis:** Conduct a thorough review to identify lessons learned and improve future response.

**4. Develop Communication Plan**

* Establish a clear and consistent communication plan.
* Identify authorized spokespeople and establish channels for communication (e.g., email, phone, social media).
* Prepare templates and guidance for communicating with internal and external stakeholders.

**5. Establish Escalation Procedures**

* Define clear escalation paths for incidents that require additional resources or expertise.
* Ensure all team members know who to escalate to in the event of a major incident.
