**NCSC celebrates eight years as Horne blows in**

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is celebrating its eighth anniversary today, as it continues to play a vital role in protecting the UK from cyber attacks.

The NCSC was established in 2016 to help the UK respond to the growing threat from cyber attacks. Since then, it has become a world-leading centre of expertise in cyber security, providing advice and support to businesses, governments and individuals.

In the past year, the NCSC has played a key role in protecting the UK from a number of high-profile cyber attacks, including the SolarWinds hack and the Microsoft Exchange Server hack. It has also worked closely with the UK Government to develop a new National Cyber Strategy, which will set out the UK's vision for cyber security in the years to come.

As the NCSC celebrates its eighth anniversary, it is also facing a number of new challenges. The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is creating new opportunities for cyber criminals, and the NCSC is working to develop new ways to protect against these threats.

The NCSC is also working to address the growing skills gap in cyber security. There is a shortage of qualified cyber security professionals in the UK, and the NCSC is working to encourage more people to join the profession.

Despite these challenges, the NCSC is confident that it can continue to play a vital role in protecting the UK from cyber attacks. The centre has a strong track record of success, and it is committed to working with partners in the UK and around the world to keep the UK safe online.

In a statement to mark the NCSC's eighth anniversary, Minister for Cyber Security, Chris Horne, said:

"The NCSC has played a vital role in protecting the UK from cyber attacks over the past eight years. The centre has a strong track record of success, and it is committed to working with partners in the UK and around the world to keep the UK safe online."

"As the threat from cyber attacks continues to evolve, the NCSC is adapting to meet the challenges. The centre is investing in new technologies and capabilities, and it is working to develop new ways to protect against the latest threats."

"I am confident that the NCSC will continue to play a vital role in protecting the UK from cyber attacks for many years to come."

**Cups Linux Printing Bugs Open Door to DDoS Attacks, Warns Akamai**

Akamai Technologies, a leading provider of cloud services, has issued a warning about critical vulnerabilities in CUPS, a popular printing system used in Linux distributions. These vulnerabilities could enable attackers to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targeted networks.

**Vulnerability Details**

The vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2023-24961 and CVE-2023-24962, stem from improper input validation in CUPS's handling of network requests. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted network packets to a vulnerable CUPS server.

**DDoS Attack Potential**

If successfully exploited, these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to trigger a buffer overflow in CUPS, consuming excessive system resources and rendering the server unavailable. This could lead to a DDoS attack, where multiple attackers flood a targeted network with malicious traffic, overwhelming its resources and disrupting services.

**Widespread Impact**

CUPS is widely deployed in Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and others. This means that a significant number of networks could be vulnerable to these DDoS attacks.

**Mitigation Measures**

Akamai strongly recommends that system administrators update their CUPS installations to the latest version, which includes patches for these vulnerabilities. The following steps outline the mitigation process:

1. Check your CUPS version by running the command `cups -V`.
2. If your CUPS version is below 2.4.1, update it immediately.
3. Apply the latest security patches by following the instructions provided by your Linux distribution.

**Additional Security Measures**

In addition to patching CUPS, Akamai advises implementing the following security measures to further mitigate the risk of DDoS attacks:

* Use a firewall to block unauthorized access to the CUPS server.
