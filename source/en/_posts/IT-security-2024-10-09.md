Today's systems are increasingly interconnected, both within organizations and across the internet. This interconnectedness creates opportunities for attackers to gain access to systems and data that would otherwise be protected. For example, a phishing email could lead to an attacker gaining access to an employee's corporate network.

**The Human Factor**

Even with the most advanced security measures in place, humans remain the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain. Social engineering attacks, such as phishing, trick employees into giving up their passwords or other sensitive information. Insider threats, where employees intentionally or unintentionally compromise security, can also cause significant damage.

**The Need for Risk Management**

Instead of trying to eliminate risk, the cyber industry needs to shift its focus towards risk management. This involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to an acceptable level. Organizations need to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that includes both technical and non-technical measures.

**Technical Measures**

Technical measures include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software. These tools can help to protect against known threats, but they cannot prevent all attacks.

**Non-Technical Measures**

Non-technical measures include employee training, security awareness campaigns, and incident response plans. These measures can help to reduce the likelihood of human error and prepare organizations to respond effectively to breaches.

**Conclusion**

The cyber industry's goal of eliminating risk is unrealistic and unsustainable. Instead, organizations need to shift their focus towards risk management. By identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks, they can reduce the likelihood and impact of cyber attacks.
