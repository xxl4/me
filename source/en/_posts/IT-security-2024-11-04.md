* Extract facial features that distinguish faces from other objects. Common features include:
    * Edges and contours
    * Eye sockets
    * Nose bridge
    * Mouth

**3. Feature Detection:**
* Use edge detection techniques, such as the Canny Edge Detector, to identify edges and contours.
* Apply filters to detect specific facial features, such as the Haar Wavelet transform for eyes and nose.

**4. Feature Matching:**
* Compare the extracted features to predetermined templates or models of known faces.
* Calculate the similarity between the features and templates using algorithms such as the Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.

**5. Candidate Generation:**
* Generate candidate bounding boxes based on the matching features.
* Refine the bounding boxes by removing overlapping and invalid boxes.

**6. Classification:**
* Use a machine learning classifier, such as a support vector machine (SVM) or neural network, to determine if the candidates are actually faces.
* The classifier has been trained on a dataset of labeled face images.

**7. Confidence Estimation:**
* Calculate a confidence score for each detected face to indicate the likelihood of its accuracy.
* This score is used to filter out false positives.

**Techniques Used in Face Detection:**

* **Viola-Jones Algorithm:** A classical face detection algorithm that uses Haar wavelets and AdaBoost to identify features.

## What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/two-factor-authentication)

Published: Mon, 28 Oct 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security system that requires users to provide two forms of identification when logging into an account. This typically involves a password (which is known as something you know) and a second factor, such as a one-time code sent to your phone (which is known as something you have).

2FA is more secure than traditional password-only authentication because it makes it much more difficult for attackers to gain access to your account, even if they have your password. This is because they would also need to have access to your phone or other device that is used to receive the second factor.

There are many different types of 2FA, but some of the most common include:

* **SMS-based 2FA:** This is the most popular type of 2FA, and it involves sending a one-time code to your phone via SMS.
* **App-based 2FA:** This type of 2FA uses an app on your phone to generate one-time codes.
* **Hardware-based 2FA:** This type of 2FA uses a physical device, such as a USB security key, to generate one-time codes.

2FA is a simple and effective way to improve the security of your online accounts. If you are not already using 2FA, I strongly recommend that you start doing so.

The campaigner's lawyer, Ben Emmerson QC, said that the lawsuit is "the first of its kind" and that it will "shed light on the extent to which Saudi Arabia is using spyware to target dissidents living in the UK."

"This is a landmark case that could have far-reaching implications for the future of democracy and freedom of expression in the digital age," Mr. Emmerson said.

The lawsuit comes at a time of heightened tensions between the UK and Saudi Arabia over the kingdom's human rights record. In recent months, the UK government has been criticized for its decision to sell arms to Saudi Arabia, which is accused of war crimes in Yemen.

The lawsuit is also likely to fuel calls for the UK government to take a tougher stance on Saudi Arabia's use of spyware. In November 2021, the UK government announced that it would be reviewing its export controls on spyware, following reports that Pegasus had been used to target activists and journalists around the world.

The lawsuit is set to be a test case for the UK's commitment to protecting human rights and freedom of expression in the digital age.

## What is tailgating (piggybacking)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/tailgating-piggybacking)

Published: Thu, 17 Oct 2024 18:01:00 GMT

Tailgating, also known as piggybacking, is a technique used to gain unauthorized access to a building or other restricted area. It involves following closely behind an authorized person while they are using their access credentials, such as a key card or fingerprint scan, to enter the area. The tailgating individual can then enter without having to provide their own credentials.

Tailgating is a common security risk and can be used to breach physical security controls. To prevent tailgating, organizations can implement measures such as:

* **Using turnstiles or other physical barriers that prevent unauthorized access.**
* **Requiring multiple forms of identification before granting access.**
* **Installing video surveillance cameras to monitor entrances and exits.**
* **Training employees on how to identify and prevent tailgating.**
