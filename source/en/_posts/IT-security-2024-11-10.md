## What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/two-factor-authentication)

Published: Mon, 28 Oct 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires you to present two different pieces of evidence to verify your identity. This is typically done by combining something you know (such as a password) with something you have (such as a phone).

Here's how 2FA typically works:

1. You enter your username and password to log in to an account.
2. You are then prompted to enter a second factor, such as a code that is sent to your phone via text message or an app that generates codes.
3. You enter the code, and if it matches the code that was sent to your phone, you are granted access to the account.

2FA is a more secure way to protect your accounts because it requires someone to have both your password and your phone in order to log in. This makes it much more difficult for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password.

There are many different ways to implement 2FA, but the most common methods are:

* **SMS-based 2FA:** This is the most common type of 2FA, and it works by sending a code to your phone via text message.
* **App-based 2FA:** This type of 2FA uses an app on your phone to generate codes. This is typically more secure than SMS-based 2FA, because it does not rely on your phone number being active.
* **Hardware-based 2FA:** This type of 2FA uses a physical device, such as a USB key, to generate codes. This is the most secure type of 2FA, but it is also the most expensive.

If you are concerned about the security of your accounts, you should consider enabling 2FA. It is a simple and effective way to protect your accounts from hackers.
