## What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?
[Read more](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/two-factor-authentication)

Published: Mon, 28 Oct 2024 09:00:00 GMT

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires two different methods of authentication to verify the identity of a user. It is often used in online accounts, such as email accounts and financial accounts, to protect against unauthorized access.

The two methods of authentication typically include something the user knows (such as a password) and something the user has (such as a phone or a security key). When a user logs into an account with 2FA enabled, they will be prompted to enter both their password and a code that is sent to their phone or generated by a security key. This ensures that even if the user's password is stolen, the attacker will not be able to access their account without also having access to the second factor of authentication.

2FA is a more secure form of authentication than using a password alone, as it makes it much more difficult for attackers to compromise an account. It is recommended to use 2FA whenever possible to protect the security of your online accounts.

**Danish Government Reboots Cybersecurity Council Amid AI Expansion**

**Copenhagen, Denmark** - The Danish government has announced the reboot of its National Cybersecurity Council in response to the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for national security.

The rebooted council will focus on developing strategies to address emerging challenges posed by AI, such as:

* **AI-enabled cyberattacks:** AI can amplify the effectiveness of cyberattacks by automating reconnaissance, exploitation, and exfiltration.
* **Deepfake technology:** AI can be used to create realistic fake videos and images, which can be used to spread disinformation and manipulate public opinion.
* **Autonomous systems:** AI-powered autonomous systems, such as drones, could potentially be used for malicious purposes.

**Key Objectives of the Council:**

* Assess and mitigate the risks associated with the integration of AI into cybersecurity systems.
* Develop guidelines for the secure deployment and use of AI technologies.
* Foster collaboration between academia, industry, and government to develop innovative solutions.

The council will be led by the Minister for Digitalization and Minister for Defense, and include representatives from various government agencies, industry experts, and academic institutions.

**Minister for Digitalization Nana Hauge:** "AI presents both opportunities and challenges for our national cybersecurity. We must take action now to ensure that we are well-prepared to address emerging threats and protect our critical infrastructure, citizens, and businesses."

**Minister for Defense Morten Bødskov:** "The military domain is increasingly reliant on AI technologies. This rebooted council will enable us to coordinate our efforts and develop a comprehensive strategy to safeguard our national security in the digital age."

The government emphasizes the importance of international cooperation in addressing cybersecurity challenges. Denmark will continue to engage with its allies and partners to develop common standards and share best practices.

The rebooted National Cybersecurity Council is a testament to the Danish government's commitment to staying ahead of the curve in cybersecurity. By leveraging the expertise and collaboration of multiple stakeholders, Denmark aims to strengthen its defenses against evolving threats and maintain its position as a leading digital nation.

## Labour’s 10-year health service plan will open up data sharing

**Labour's 10-Year Health Service Plan: Opening Up Data Sharing**

Labour's recently released 10-year health service plan outlines several key priorities, including improving patient care through increased data sharing. The plan proposes a number of measures to achieve this goal, including:

* **Creating a new national data platform:** This platform would provide a secure and standardized way for health data to be shared between different healthcare providers, researchers, and patients.
* **Making patient data more accessible:** Patients would have the right to access and control their own health data, and to share it with third parties if they wish.
* **Encouraging the development of new data-driven technologies:** The plan would provide funding for research and development into new technologies that can use health data to improve patient care.

These measures are designed to address the current challenges associated with data sharing in the NHS. These challenges include:

* **Lack of a standardized data format:** Different healthcare providers use different data formats, which makes it difficult to share data between them.
* **Concerns about data privacy:** Patients are concerned about the privacy of their health data, and they may be reluctant to share it with third parties.
* **Lack of infrastructure:** The NHS does not have the infrastructure in place to support large-scale data sharing.

Labour's plan aims to overcome these challenges and create a more open and data-driven health service. By making it easier to share health data, the plan hopes to improve patient care, reduce costs, and accelerate the development of new treatments.

**Benefits of Increased Data Sharing**

Increased data sharing could have a number of benefits for the NHS, including:

* **Improved patient care:** Data sharing can help healthcare professionals to make more informed decisions about patient care, and to identify and manage risks.
* **Reduced costs:** Data sharing can help the NHS to identify and reduce waste, and to target its resources more effectively.
* **Accelerated development of new treatments:** Data sharing can help researchers to develop new treatments and technologies more quickly, and to bring them to market faster.

**Conclusion**

Labour's 10-year health service plan includes a number of measures to improve data sharing in the NHS. These measures are designed to address the current challenges associated with data sharing, and to create a more open and data-driven health service. By making it easier to share health data, the plan hopes to improve patient care, reduce costs, and accelerate the development of new treatments.
