Today is Tuesday, November 28, 2024. I am in Shanghai, China. It is a sunny day with a high of 15Â°C. I woke up at 7:00 AM and had breakfast at the company. I had a metting with the team at 9:00 AM. We discussed the progress of the project and the upcoming deadlines. I had lunch at a local restaurant with my colleagues. I spent the afternoon working on the project and preparing for the presentation tomorrow. I had dinner at a nearby cafe and went back to the hotel to rest. Tomorrow will be a busy day with the presentation and meetings. I am looking forward to it. Good night.
