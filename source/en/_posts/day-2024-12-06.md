Today is Friday, the last day of the work week. It's a cloudy day in Shanghai. I woke up at 7:00 am and started my day with a cup of warm water.

In China, it's common to drink warm water in the morning. It's believed that drinking warm water can help to improve digestion and metabolism. 
I don't know if it's true, but I like to start my day with a cup of warm water.

After breakfast, I went to work. The traffic was not too bad today, so I arrived at the office on time. I spent the morning working on some reports and had a meeting with my team.
