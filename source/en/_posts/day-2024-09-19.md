Today is Thursday. I have a lot of work to do. I have to finish the work before Saturday. I hope I can finish it on time.

When i am sad, I like thinking about the future. I want to back to the kid time. I want to have father and mother to take care of me. I want to have a happy family. 

I did not see my father for a long time. I miss him and my mother. I hope they are happy. I hope they are healthy. Mom has died for a long time, and i miss her very much. When i dream of her, i feel very happy, because i can see her, i can talk to her. I hope she can take care of me in my dream. I hope she can take care of me in my life. I hope she can take care of me in my future. I hope she can take care of me forever.

My Mom and my father are the best parents in the world for me with my brother.They are diligent, kind, and honest.
