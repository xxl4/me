## Secureworks: Ransomware takedowns didn’t put off cyber criminals
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366613078/Secureworks-Ransomware-takedowns-didnt-put-off-cyber-criminals)

Published: Tue, 08 Oct 2024 15:53:00 GMT

**Ransomware Takedowns Didn't Deter Cyber Criminals**

Secureworks, a cybersecurity firm, has conducted a study that shows that ransomware takedowns have not deterred cyber criminals. In fact, the study found that ransomware attacks have increased in both frequency and severity.

**Key Findings**

* The number of ransomware attacks increased by 69% in 2022 compared to 2021.
* The average ransomware payment increased by 13% in 2022, to $812,000.
* Ransomware attacks are becoming more targeted and sophisticated.

**Reasons for Increase in Ransomware Attacks**

Secureworks attributes the increase in ransomware attacks to several factors, including:

* The rise of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), which makes it easier for less skilled criminals to launch attacks.
* The growth of cryptocurrency, which makes it easier for criminals to collect and launder ransom payments.
* The shortage of cybersecurity professionals, which makes it harder for organizations to defend against attacks.

**Impact of Ransomware Takedowns**

Secureworks' study found that ransomware takedowns have not had a significant impact on the overall volume of ransomware attacks. This is because takedowns often target the infrastructure used by ransomware gangs, but the gangs themselves can simply move to new infrastructure.

**Conclusion**

Secureworks' study concludes that ransomware takedowns are not an effective deterrent against cyber criminals. Instead, organizations need to focus on implementing strong cybersecurity measures and educating employees about the risks of ransomware.

**UK's Cyber Incident Reporting Law to Move Forward in 2025**

The United Kingdom (UK) is set to implement a new law in 2025 that will require organizations to report cyber incidents to the government. The law, known as the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Cyber Incident Reporting Regulations 2022, was announced by the UK government in March 2022.

The law will require organizations to report all cyber incidents that have a "significant impact" on their operations or the UK's national security. Organizations will have 72 hours to report an incident to the NCSC after it occurs.

The NCSC will use the information reported by organizations to develop a better understanding of the cyber threat landscape and to improve its response to cyber incidents. The NCSC will also share information with other government agencies and law enforcement agencies.

The law is expected to have a significant impact on organizations in the UK. Organizations will need to develop and implement procedures for reporting cyber incidents to the NCSC. They will also need to train their employees on how to recognize and report cyber incidents.

The law is part of the UK government's broader strategy to improve the UK's cybersecurity. The government has also invested in new cybersecurity technologies and initiatives, and it has worked to raise awareness of cybersecurity issues.

The UK's cyber incident reporting law is an important step forward in the fight against cybercrime. The law will help the UK government to better understand the cyber threat landscape and to improve its response to cyber incidents. It will also help organizations to better protect themselves from cyberattacks.
