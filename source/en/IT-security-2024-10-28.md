**London, United Kingdom** - Democracy campaigner and former UKIP leader Henry Bolton is set to sue the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia over the alleged use of Pegasus and QuaDream spyware to target his phone.

Bolton claims that his phone was hacked by Saudi agents using the sophisticated spyware, which allowed them to access his private communications, including messages, emails, and location data. He alleges that the targeting was politically motivated and aimed at silencing his criticism of the Saudi regime.

The lawsuit, filed in the High Court of Justice in London, alleges that Saudi Arabia violated Bolton's right to privacy and freedom of expression under the European Convention on Human Rights. Bolton is seeking damages and an injunction to prevent Saudi Arabia from further surveillance activities.

"This is an outrageous attack on my fundamental rights," said Bolton. "I will not be silenced by the Saudi regime. They cannot be allowed to get away with this egregious violation of my privacy."

Pegasus and QuaDream are powerful spyware programs developed by the Israeli company NSO Group. They have been linked to numerous human rights abuses worldwide, including the surveillance and targeting of journalists, activists, and political opponents.

The Saudi Arabian government has denied any involvement in hacking Bolton's phone. However, there have been growing concerns about the kingdom's use of spyware to suppress dissent both domestically and abroad.

Bolton's lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal challenges against governments and tech companies over the use of Pegasus and other spyware. It comes amid increasing pressure on states to regulate the use of such intrusive surveillance technologies.

The outcome of Bolton's lawsuit could have significant implications for the accountability of governments that employ spyware and for the protection of privacy rights in the digital age.

## Robust cloud IAM should align to zero-trust principles
[Read more](https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Robust-cloud-IAM-should-align-to-zero-trust-principles)

Published: Fri, 11 Oct 2024 13:26:00 GMT

**Alignment of Robust Cloud IAM with Zero-Trust Principles**

Zero-trust is a security model that assumes any entity, whether inside or outside the network, should be considered untrusted until proven otherwise. This approach requires rigorous and continuous verification of authorization and access.

Robust Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) practices align seamlessly with zero-trust principles by:

**1. Least Privilege:**
* Granting users and services only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
* Zero-trust eliminates implicit trust and requires explicit authorization for each access request.

**2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
* Requiring multiple factors of authentication, such as a password and a one-time code sent to a phone, to verify identity.
* Zero-trust mitigates the risk of compromised credentials by adding extra layers of security.

**3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
* Assigning users and services to roles that define their access permissions.
* Zero-trust ensures that access is granted based on granular roles, reducing the risk of over-privileged accounts.

**4. Continuous Monitoring and Auditing:**
* Actively monitoring and logging all access attempts to identify suspicious activity.
* Zero-trust requires auditable logs and alerts to detect and respond to breaches in real-time.

**5. Just-in-Time (JIT) and Just-Enough-Time (JET) Access:**
* Granting access only when needed, for a limited duration.
* Zero-trust ensures that users do not have permanent access to resources, reducing the attack surface.

**6. Microsegmentation:**
* Dividing the network into smaller, isolated segments to limit the impact of breaches.
* Zero-trust assumes that breaches may occur and mitigates their spread by containing access within specific segments.

**7. End-to-End Encryption:**
* Encrypting data in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.
* Zero-trust ensures data confidentiality even if the network is compromised.

By embracing these principles, Cloud IAM contributes to a comprehensive zero-trust security posture that:

* **Verifies identity:** Through rigorous authentication and authorization processes.
* **Limits access:** By granting only the necessary permissions and for the shortest possible time.
* **Monitors and responds:** By continuously detecting and mitigating threats.

Robust Cloud IAM and zero-trust are complementary approaches that enhance overall security by minimizing the attack surface, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring that only authorized users and services can access resources.

**Summary:**

The UK government has introduced a new cyber security standard specifically designed for local authorities. This standard aims to enhance the cyber resilience of local councils and protect critical services from cyber threats.

**Key Features of the Standard:**

* **Risk Assessment and Prioritization:** Councils must conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential cyber threats and prioritize mitigation measures accordingly.
* **Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan:** Councils must develop and maintain a robust incident response plan that outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a cyberattack.
* **Cybersecurity Awareness and Training:** Councils are required to provide ongoing cybersecurity awareness training to all staff, including basic security measures and incident reporting procedures.
* **Secure Technologies and Practices:** Councils must implement secure technologies and practices, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure access controls.
* **Collaboration and Information Sharing:** Councils are encouraged to collaborate with neighboring councils and other organizations to share information and best practices related to cyber security.

**Benefits of the Standard:**

* Enhanced cyber resilience for local authorities, reducing the risk of successful cyberattacks.
* Protection of critical council services, such as social care, education, and waste management.
* Improved public trust in local government's ability to protect sensitive information.
* Alignment with national cyber security standards and best practices.

**Implementation and Timeline:**

The cyber standard is mandatory for all local authorities in England. Councils have until March 2024 to fully implement the standard. The government is providing support and guidance to councils to assist with implementation.

**Quotes from Minister:**

Oliver Dowden, Minister for the Cabinet Office, said: "Cyber security is vital for our national security. Local authorities play a crucial role in providing essential services to our communities, and we must ensure they are protected from cyber threats."

"This new standard will help local councils to strengthen their cyber defenses, protect public services, and build resilience against cyberattacks."
